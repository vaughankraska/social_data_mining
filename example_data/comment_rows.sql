I'd be happy to answer any question you have if you want to message me. 

To sum up my feelings - activists think that corporations are trying to derail COP21. That is absurd. Developed countries have been trying to utilize the private sector for innovation technology and filling in a $100 billion dollar finance gap we need to close by 2020. Any representative has been asked to be there to find a solution. To say corporations shouldn't be involved is basically telling us we can't leverage some of our greatest financial and innovation assets in a multilateral decision process. That's harmful when our goal is to reach $100 billion and keep climate change under 2 or 1.5 celsius.

I have no problem with advocacy, but if you want "the voice of the people" look at the multiple organizations and NGOs that were invited as well as organizations like IISD that do transparency reporting. Your voice of the people is there. Activists saying that corporations are "derailing" the negotiation process are missing the point of COP21 in the first place, and are being distracting.

I don't care if these corporations committed historical ecocide in context to COP21. We are all there because all nations are respectively committing ecocide, the US being first and foremost. The POINT of this negotiation, is that all nations and respective institutions and businesses are trying to create a solution. 

There is nothing one-sided here in terms of the deliberation. These negotiations will determine the role of corporations, governments, and NGOs in finding a multilateral agreement. A HUGE majority of that multilateral agreement hinges on tech innovation, climate finance, and loss and damage, which corporations have a huge role in. 

Final point - to say, as the activists are, that corporations don't have a right to be in the negotiation process is as pointless as you telling me the activists have a right to represent "the people" when legitimate organizations are doing that, respectfully and without trying to cause unnecessary drama. 

What is your point? That the activists aren't being included? That constituent interests aren't being represented? See above answer. You're fighting the right battle here, but for the wrong people.', '{"2024-12-16T09:18:53":1}', 'false', null), ('cxqtvrq', '3vtick', 'COP21', 't1_cxqt1f5', 'qrxei', '2015-12-07 23:58:56+00', 'I'm not offended - I don't see why you should be, I respect your opinion.  But you keep framing certain arguments and then back peddling out of those arguments.  I never said the protesters were the sole voice for the people, but the average citizen does have a right to protest under the auspices of Free Speech.  Derailing the COP21 isn't their only argument.  Anyone who speaks out is immediately silenced, arrested or dragged away . . . they aren't being violent.

And let's discuss the organizations that are there representing the people . . . they are hardly addressed or recognized and are deliberately removed from certain talks and negotiations that are going on with no excuses or explanations given.  They aren't interviewed by mass media and have often been hushed up when questions or debates come up on certain points some leaders or CEOs have made.

I never said corporations don't have a right to be there, but they are leading and influencing the discussions in ways that are considered a conflict of interest by many.  And in the same breath and token, the corporations have a right to make decisions about the world's future, medicine costs, the quality of food they eat, the right to sue communities if those communities are doing something that gets in the way of the corporations profits and etc behind closed doors without acknowledging the public at all?  They, along with nations, are responsible for climate change and global warming; how many years have these corporations and the US government blamed the average citizen for such atrocities taking place in the environment all the while skirting their own responsibilities?  Now they want to be a part of the "healing" process?  It's suspicious.

Also, FYI - China is the number one environmental offender as far as ecocide is concerned.  ', '{"2024-12-16T09:18:53":1}', 'false', null), ('cxqzp07', '3vngh7', 'COP21', 't3_3vngh7', 'jl3fh', '2015-12-08 02:33:30+00', 'Nice list - how about adding:

What have I back pedaled on? I honestly think we're both assuming what each other are saying and then coming to the wrong conclusions. That's not backpedaling, but that's not a conversation either. So...I'm sorry! Let's try again.

The average citizen has a right to protest, but not if its disrupting the negotiation process, which is what protestors like Toxic Tour are doing. To say organizations are being removed from certain negotiations, people are pointing at informal negotiation processes between countries and saying that NGOs aren't being involved. That's missing the point of an informal negotiation - it's difficult to air one's grievances with another country if you have an organization with its own agenda looming over your shoulder. As hard as this can be to fathom, that can actually derail one-on-one negotiation processes between countries. That's not good for negotiation. Regarding their ability to be addressed and recognized, I disagree. The first two days of COP21 were presentations by all countries and NGOs, and they were given their respective times. They were also interviewed and reported on social media. For example, Sierra Club did quite well in its representation and twitter presence.

I think it's odd to say a corporation is "leading and influencing" a discussion when they don't have a negotiation say. What makes you come to that conclusion - what specifically?

I'd say they aren't. If an LDC shoots down a proposal, a corporation doesn't have a say in it, and the negotiation moves on. In the COP21, only a country can make a negotiation proposal or objection. 

Regarding the individual - average citizens are the majority of pollution in the US. Transportation emissions are majority of our GHGs. Majority of our energy is from homeowner emissions, meaning we burn to ensure energy to our homes. That's not really the point though - I think it's very typical for us to point at a spooky corporation and say "That's the bad guy! They have no soul! They're trying to hurt our interests" and that has a place. But not at COP21 - especially since they 1) have no direct voting representation 2) will not influence a decision because decisions have to come from majority, and LDCs and SISs don't have a corporate stake, and 3) their stake is only one small part in a multi-faceted agreement that they have no part in.

Honestly, give me a specific, legitimate example of a corporation trying to derail the negotiation process, and I'll entertain the protestors. Until then, THIS IS ALL HEARSAY. Repeat, this. is. all. hearsay.

Regarding China - they have the greatest total emissions, yes, but not per capita emissions and not historical emissions. Historically, that is still the US or the UK. From a historical standpoint, it's still the US. That is why they're still debating on historical responsibility, which is a huge conflict point in the ADP, and why China's stance is similar to Least Developing Nations.', '{"2024-12-16T09:18:53":1}', 'false', null), ('cxrssgk', '3vtick', 'COP21', 't1_cxr3as1', 'qrxei', '2015-12-08 19:35:22+00', 'Ok, I don't have time at the moment to get into the full argument - I will have some more time later tonight to get into it . . . but I just don't want you to think I've forgotten about you . . . in the mean time, here's some sources for you to mull over and we can talk about them later.

Clow doesn't even describe a carbon credit accurately; this guy doesn't have any clue regarding what he's talking about. I will go through each point step by step with you if you want me to debunk it.

From you - I honestly want to know why you think the "activists" being dragged out is a problem, and what is problematic for COP21. The way I see it, a group of people, misunderstanding the negotiation process and the role of corporate presence at the conference, have misplaced concerns. It's misplaced because they don't understand what is happening at COP21. That is the only case here.

If you think that they are influencing countries- I encourage you to look up the agenda of the conference. No one is negotiating for a particular type of energy. That isn't even in the negotiating text. Countries have their own "nationally determined contributions" where they detail what their own national energy plans are. You should look there for that information.

Subjectively, regarding nuclear power, I want to propose this line of thinking for you: every type of energy creates waste. Even solar; to manufacture a solar panel requires manufacturing, usually in a carbon powered plant. Corporations aren't polluting for pollution's sake. A lot of these energy companies are generating to meet OUR energy demands. So it's partially our fault. 

Nuclear power has come a long way since the 60s and 70s, the waste is now minimal and does have a contingency for storage and maintenance, and more importantly, it generates ZERO carbon emissions, meaning it's good for climate change. It's also still incredibly expensive. Subjectively, ask this question: why would an energy corporation, which has invested multimillions in a specific industry (coal, oil, etc.) want to advocate for a technology that is more expensive? It makes no sense. It hurts their revenue and their bottom line. 

And to further debate: this is STILL just hearsay. In addition to the fact that it makes no sense, based on the reason I just gave you, I haven't seen one article verifying the claim for corporations wanting nuclear. As for my claims saying that corporations aren't influencing negotiations for nuclear - look up a country, any country in the negotiation, and find their "reported INDC". You can probably just Google it. To see the text they're debating on, look up "ADP negotiations draft text". They'll both comprehensively outline exactly what has been done for climate change, what will be done, and what is to be negotiated on in Paris.

Having read the entire 85 page paper, I can tell you this: they're negotiating on target climate level, classifications for country, loss and damage, and international finance. The private sector is only mentioned in international finance.

Although I realize the corporations don't have any "voting" rights, they do influence the talks with the financial support they give to the summit as well as the countries of interest.  There has been much speculation in the news in the last few days of certain countries trying to get in the way of certain talks that would directly affect them and their developing industries that rely on fossil fuels.

And, as far as nuclear power is concerned - like I said, I'm sure it can be safe and amazing if harnessed correctly.  But we don't even address, take care of, take responsibility nor acknowledge the numerous amount of chemical and nuclear waste sites that litter the country.

There's no consideration of nuclear, because it wasn't in the talks to begin with, and there's no addendum for corporate "land grabs" or a carbon market.

Speculation on countries trying to get in the way of certain talks is normal - you have a country like Saudi Arabia where majority of their industry is oil. Of course they're going to push for fossils: that's part of the negotiation process.
