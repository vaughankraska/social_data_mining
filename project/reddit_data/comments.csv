~~iiiieyyeah heyy, ye i totally agree that it's so hypocritical to take a plane that emits so much pollution to a climate change protest :'2

but, i am spaniard, and am only a expat in korea with a visa that will kick me out in 1 year anyway, so i have to take a plane at some point or another to get back to europe anyway. 

i guess the reason i want to be in Paris is because it's the main place for the #billionpeoplemarch. I want to meet people face to face there, bc people will be coming from all over the world for it. They won't be coming to korea for it. There, I can document it and it's a once in a lifetime chance for to ever meet inspiring people and make a substantial documentary >,<

yep you're right there will be a march in most large capitals around the world. but, a bigger reason for me to be leaving korea is because the company I work for does illegal practices and I've been meaning to quit anyway. I want to quit and do something more fulfilling than working at a company that treats employees like pawns and scrounge for every last penny T_T. If i quit my job, my visa expires so I must leave Korea anyway.

As a preface to my question: too often it feels as if global climate change agreements focus entirely on emissions reduction targets, and do very little to explain how those targets will be achieved. For example, with coal expected to continue to be the world's go-to source for electricity for many decades to come, how can any country - for example India - realistically claim it will be able to reduce emissions without significant (and some would say unrealistic levels of) investment and cooperation from business? Perhaps a global price on carbon would help in this regard, but it's sounding like that's less and less likely.

In short, what good are emissions reduction targets without concrete plans for encouraging investment, and indeed ensuring investment, into energy efficiency and low-carbon sources of energy?","{""2024-12-16T10:06:56"":12}",false,

2: During previous negotiations, there have been mentions of production-based versus consumption-based emissions accounting. Ultimately, it seems that this was never adopted.

> It's hard to take climate scientists flying all over the globe seriously.

All scientists need to fly all over the globe. It's needed because each researcher is extremely specialized and needs to interact with several communities of ultra-experts. Each of these communities is constantly reshaping itself (new PhDs, new postdocs, change in interests or research goals...), has a few dozens of members, and is disseminated around the entire planet. Current video-conferencing technology is simply not appropriate. When it becomes appropriate, it will be used, because researchers are not rich and transportation costs are often a problem for them.

>Just like everyone else, no difference.

Extemely few people are in that situation. Only high-level diplomats, the top management of international companies, and transportation professionals come to mind. Most people work office jobs and go there every day by car because public transportation implies a ten minute walk to the bus station; they take the plane for a vacation 600kms away; they ignore the environmental costs of their food and gadgets; and so on. This is what is causing worldwide climate change. Not scientists or government officials taking the plane every now and then for professional obligations (although of course they should also make efforts - to the extent that it is appropriate and still allows them to do their job). As for the OP, the goal of her job is a decrease emissions. The potential benefits of achieving a tiny improvement to an agreement, due to an extra plane trip, **far** outweigh the carbon cost of that plane trip.","{""2024-12-16T10:11:24"":-4}",true,

I've found some blogs disputing some of these comparisons, but most of their arguments come down to a) pets provide companionship that outweight their footprint (e.g. value judgment), or b) pets eat the waste that would go to landfill, which is increasingly not the case in modern society. 

This is the only decent criticism of the claim, which essential attacks part of the math involved.... while at the same time acknowledging that there's a carbon footprint; perhaps its only the amount of a Honda civic instead of a Toyota Land Cruiser.

It's incredibly difficult to propose policies that emphasise the need for considerable change, especially relating to diet. [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3382952/) offers an example of how terminology alone can influence the willingness to shift dietary behaviours - an issue that can currently be evidenced following the WHO's classification of processed and red meats as potential carcinogens and attempts to lessen concerns relating to their consumption due to personal habits.

However, although modeled studies largely suggest significant changes are required to achieve an optimal sustainable diet there is potential for progressive, acceptable change. This can be observed with how the DASH diet, a presumed socially acceptable diet, suggests a positive relationship with measures of sustainability/climate change (something I briefly wrote about [here](http://www.zxrayson.com/looking-to-the-future-the-old-western-diet/)).

You can create policies that *encourage* people to do this, but increasing demand for meat is a runaway worldwide phenomenon well-known to be concurrent with increases in income. China in particular is driving increased demand as its economy transitions, but a richer world in general just means more meat consumption. *Encouraging everyone in the world to eat less meat* is a massive undertaking that is unlikely to have the impact needed unless it carries the force of law, which in and of itself contains massive ethical issues.

> Yes I am very conscious that I am personally a high emitter given the air travel that I have to do for my job. It does seem in congruous to be fully aware of the need to reduce emissions and yet for the time being be such a high emitter myself. As long as I have the responsibilities that I do, I have to incur these emissions but that will not be my lifestyle forever. In the meantime, in order to be climate neutral and support mitigation and adaptation projects in developing countries, I have purchased Certified Emissions Reductions from the Adaptation Fund using the Climate Neutral Now program (http://climateneutralnow.org/SitePages/Home.aspx[1] ) and I encourage everyone to do the same, as well as making low-emission lifestyle choices.

Notably, China and India refused to engage. Now they are engaging (through Herculean efforts by Obama). So the goals aren't as abstract as you make them sound. The Paris accord will achieve significant reductions in developed nations by 2030. Most countries are already on the path to these reductions. That's not 7 US presidencies - that's about half of that. Keep in mind that these are long-term issues that require long-term solutions. We can't just eliminate coal power in one year. We can't build enough solar panels in one year to move everything to renewables. But under Obama's presidency we've seen the largest wave of coal power pant closures ever (roughly 1/3 of them).

So the idea behind this is that every developed nation sets a BENCHMARK for reductions by 2030, as a part of more significant reductions idea by 2050. This means looking out and saying ""How do we get to x in renewables?"" So like India is building solar/wind to power 20% of their country's grid. But not overnight. China's current goal is to STOP the rise of emissions by 2030. Again, this isn't an abstract goal. This is a measurable, achievable goal.

Part of what this accord is going to do is solidify payments for the Green Fund, where developed nations will help developing nations create a smarter power grid.

The hope is that as these countries put the R&D money in, the cost of going carbon-free gets exponentially cheaper. Solar has already fallen 80+ percent in a decade. Eventually, ie, within the term of the Accords, the cost for India to burn coal will be more expensive (in real dollars, not in environmental impact) than installing solar.

That's what we're doing here. For the first time, the entire world is saying this is a problem and we ALL have to help fix it. There are different standards for developing and developed nation, but this will be the floor.

Also to your point, Obama plans to include in the Accord a series of every-5-year conferences. The goal is that in 5 years, 2019, we will reconvene and determine that, perhaps, the China goal wasn't ambitious enough, and they're going to cap carbon in 2025 instead. Perhaps increases in technology make this feasible. So if you think of it as a line graph, every country has their intended destination by 2030, but hopefully advances in technology change the trajectory, and we have more conferences, more frequently, to adjust our goals accordingly.

It's gonna be a long, hard, fight. We need to try and arrest climate change by 2050. Then we can work on cooling the planet back down via reforestation and the like. But understand that we are finally, for the first time in the modern age, attacking this problem AGGRESSIVELY.

This means that even if we use data that we've had all along (not just waiting for more data to appear) we're not ""back-testing"" on observations that've been seen during the training step. 

Some simple examples:  
 * Train on observations up through the year 2000 and then test on 2001-present ~~and~~ in order to validate the results  
 * Pick certain locations to train and test on (train on data from Boston and see if these trends can generalize and predict the behavior of weather in NYC)

Science is really specific, you specialise in something really super specific your whole career often to the exclusion of others, and it isolates you. One problem with discussing climate science is then that is a hugely varied area covering multiple, massive fields of science. What a lot of people do, occasionally maliciously but sometimes just out of genuine desire for knowledge and not having all of the pieces of the puzzle, is jump around and bombard you with questions from a huge range and variety of unrelated areas and expect you to be an expert in all of them, but sometimes you might not be and *that's not evidence of wrongdoing or problems with the work*.

It's important to note that the climate convention, is a *framework* convention. And what it's mostly done is get countries to agree to have emissions reduction targets and to take domestic action on climate change, but *how* they meet those targets or what action they take is up to them. It doesn't dictate what laws or regulations they should have, because the countries involved care a great deal about protecting their sovereignty. And so, it's a little beyond the purview of the UNFCCC to tell countries to do something about agricultural emissions, or emissions from any other specific sector. Not saying that it's good or right that it's like that, just explaining that how it is currently.

Secondly, agriculture is a particularly difficult issue at the international negotiations. This is for a few reasons: 

* We have to remember that the UNFCCC is countries talking to each other, and that for many of the countries there agriculture is subsistence farmers trying to feed vulnerable populations, its not big industrial processes. They absolutely do not want to talk about reducing emissions from livestock, they want to talk about protecting their small scale farmers and protecting yields from climate impacts so that their people have enough to eat. And they're allowed to have those concerns, for most of them their emissions are negligible, climate action is more about adaptation than mitigation for them. 

* How would you actually go about tackling emissions from industrial agriculture at a global level? Putting in place international laws or regulations is pretty much out of the question, the UNFCCC just doesn't have that kind of power. So next you'd want to turn to some kind of market mechanism. This is an issue that often gets spoken about at the negotiations. It is mostly the US, Australia and New Zealand that push for this, and it is because they have high emissions from agriculture and so a market mechanism to reduce them could allow them to take pressure of the energy sector and their powerful fossil fuel lobbies. However, just like above, developing and vulnerable countries do not want a bar of this. Many of them have had negative experiences with other international carbon markets such as the CDM and REDD+, they do not want to expose their small scale farmers to the corruption and negativity that can come with market intervention. They want to protect them and foster domestic food security. The UN is one country one vote, so the voices of these vulnerable countries matter. 

* It is easier for countries to first tackle emissions from fossil fuels, because there are replacements for those in all different stages of development and we don't actually **need** fossil fuels. But we have to eat, and while there are ways to reduce and minimise emissions from agriculture, we can not eliminate them all together. By tackling fossil fuels first we are ticking off easier items on the decarbonisation to do list first. 

* Yes the fact that people LOVE steaks and see any negativity towards that as an attack on their personal lifestyle plays a part - but at the international negotiations, this takes a back seat to the issues above.

This is not to say that agriculture doesn't get spoken about at all. There are lots and lots of side events on agriculture, but the focus is more on protecting vulnerable farmers and insuring that climate impacts doesn't jeopardise people's ability to eat. And the second focus, which is more within the main negotiation track, is accounting methods for agricultural emissions, there is a lot of work still to be done here internationally to develop an accounting framework that is both robust and transparent, but also that all countries can apply.

There simply isn't enough accuracy OR precision in the input data to these ""modele"" in order for them to produce accuracy.  They're all relying on fudge-factors and other assumptions on values that have yet to be tested in a scientific manner.    The mathematics should be able to produce an accurate answer on their own without being manipulated by the kinds of mathematical fondling that the data is being given.  For more than 250 models they produce wildly varying results no matter how often they re-work the method.

In the end all the modele' they've made are useless because we just recently discovered that evaporation isn't only driven by temperature and vapor pressure.

A ""modele'"" is roughly an ""artists' impression"" of a modeled system.  It is NOT a working mathematical system that produces results - it is a representation of a desired formulaic system that can be further refined through analysis of its responses to input data.   Many of the modele' that we have been shown have been through hundreds of adjustments and there are hundreds of modele' and they simply do not produce results that match real-world measurements.

Basically all we've gotten from all this is 300 examples that scientists with degrees have no idea what they're talking about.   Its an abject and utter failure.   The entire *ASSUMPTION* of anthropogenic climate change through CO2 has at this point been proven wrong by these modele'.   That's a null-theory consensus of repeated attempts to prove ""Global Warming"" to be related to CO2.   But we're no longer calling it Global Warming, We're calling it Climate Change.  Why are people still shouting about huge increases in temperature?  Because the main driving force behind it takes on an almost religious aspect of ""that's what it was when I joined and remains what I think I'm fighting against.""

So what do we do?   We need to do actual scientific data gathering.  We need to take the billions that are spent each year on political meanderings and spend them on measuring the temperature of the planet in a scientific instead of the random hap-hazard methods of averaging dissimilar readings across randomly sized areas.   Measurements of the total energy input of humanity must be made; albedo from structures, heat energy from fossil fuels, thermal displacement from flows in storm and waste sewers, rivers and bays.

When we can then produce accurate *scientific* maps of temperature we'll be more able to filter the uneven nature of industrialized humanity out of the background natural processes.

As is right now with the ""data"" they keep trying to use, we have an error margin that their modele' only magnify.  They simply cannot produce science from what is effectively a massive grid of anecdotal readings.  Every time they adjust a record up or down they *magnify* the natural errors that occur in the readings.  Before precision digital recording the error could be as much as 3 degrees on an older thermometer.

So by adjusting the data into curves and waves they are trying to force their faulty modele' into being true.  If the modele' can't produce accuracy without altered data, it won't produce any with it either.


The methodology of research and study on climate and the energy dynamics of the atmosphere needs to receive a drastic amount of inspection, all it has done to this point as an organized effort is made a fool of itself.

If the science was settled, it wouldn't need to hire lawyers and start lawsuits and do propaganda advertising or send people to rally ""believers"" in public forums.   It would speak for itself and tell me what temperature next year would be, not give me a random range between -2 and +8 degrees.

The tropospheric water vapour feedback is well understood: the addition of a greenhouse gas (i.e CO2) to the atmosphere leads to a warming of the earths surface and troposphere. A warmer troposphere means the air there is able to hold more water, and a warmer surface means greater evaporation. Both lead to there being an increase in the concentration of H2O in the troposphere. And as that H2O (vapour) is a greenhouse gas itself, more warming occurs and the cycle repeats itself. 

Some then have postulated the existence of a stratospheric water vapour feedback, due to observed warming of the stratosphere and increased stratospheric humidity. I am not particularly familiar with this, but as I understand it more water is escaping the to the stratosphere due to air near the tropopause being deficient in condensation nuclei.

That's because it hasn't existed in its present form for more than 20 years or so.

I've given you a valid criticism, one other scientists share. And you've naturally freaked out because your politics have been insulted.

Ask yourself this: if I had two climate models, how would I determine which one had better predictive power? Is it possible to prove the results false? If you can't it's not science, it's conjecture.

If cows eat plants, they are taking out part of the ecosystem that absorbs CO2.  However, I realize that this is regenerated.  Additionally, IIRC, when you clear forest areas for farmland, you are taking out trees which actually take out more CO2 than farmland.  If methane breaks down into CO2 and H2O, you are essentially saying that livestock contribute to both atmospheric methane and CO2.   

Your point about Methane depleting in the air more quickly than CO2 was part of the argument made in the documentary.  Essentially, if we want to curb raising climate temperature, lowering CO2 won't have an impact for years, while decreasing methane, would have a much larger impact and much more quickly.  Additionally, if you start decreasing the average temperature now, CO2 has a better chance of balancing out based on dissolving CO2 in oceans.

So even for arguments sake, lets say that that cows/livestock are carbon neutral, the methane intermediate still in fact greatly impacts climate change.  Based on this, one of the messages that I took from the documentary, was that fossil fuel emissions are the only thing that are focused on while this aspect of climate change is completely ignored, despite us having the ability to alter our agricultural activity right now. 

I might add that the documentary did also bring up some points about water usage and sustainable resources.

There are anthropological theories that cooking food, and especially meat, gave humans extra calories which led to greater advancement as a species. So it's tough to tell people to eat less meat, no matter what the reason behind that, because we're not only wired to want protein, but culturally primed to love it.

>Not saying you are wrong but do you have a source on this? 

I'm not sure which part you want a source on. The half-life of methane? That cow's feed comes from plants?

>So the way you describe it, I don't quite follow.  If cows eat plants, they are taking out part of the ecosystem that absorbs CO2.  However, I realize that this is regenerated.

Cows are fed, let's say, corn, which was planted as a seed and acquired its mass by photosynthesis where it took CO2 out of atmosphere. Due to conservation of mass, a cow can't emit more carbon than it consumed which in turn can't be more than its feed sequestered from the atmosphere.

>  Additionally, IIRC, when you clear forest areas for farmland, you are taking out trees which actually take out more CO2 than farmland.

This is true, but a separate issue than that of livestock directly emitting CO2

>  If methane breaks down into CO2 and H2O, you are essentially saying that livestock contribute to both atmospheric methane and CO2.   

Yes, but that CO2 was already there before being absorbed by crops, eaten by the cow, and remitted. Only the time spent as methane adds more heat than it otherwise would have.

>Your point about Methane depleting in the air more quickly than CO2 was part of the argument made in the documentary.  Essentially, if we want to curb raising climate temperature, lowering CO2 won't have an impact for years, while decreasing methane, would have a much larger impact and much more quickly

The whole concern about methane is that, mole for mole, methane is a much more potent greenhouse gas. But this concern is lessened by the fact that methane breaks down relatively quickly. If you sequestered or prevented the emission of an equivalent amount of methane, it would have a greater effect, but I don't see why the response would be *fasted* per se, and the film never substantiates that point, nor does it for most of its points.

> Additionally, if you start decreasing the average temperature now, CO2 has a better chance of balancing out based on dissolving CO2 in oceans.

I don't understand what you mean here.

>So even for arguments sake, lets say that that cows/livestock are carbon neutral, the methane intermediate still in fact greatly impacts climate change.  Based on this, one of the messages that I took from the documentary, was that fossil fuel emissions are the only thing that are focused on while this aspect of climate change is completely ignored, despite us having the ability to alter our agricultural activity right now. 

I agree with this, but the film maker failed to emphasise that ultimately, livestock carbon emissions are part of a short term cycle of crops sequestering CO2 and cows re-emitting it. In between, it spends some time as methane which is concerning. By contrast,  CO2 from fossil fuels came from oil which is not going back on a human time scale 

>I might add that the documentary did also bring up some points about water usage and sustainable resources.  

Again, valid but separate points.

>Edit:  I might add, if the situation was a simple as the points that you articulated in you comment, then why didn't the expert of the AMA just come out and say so?  Just like the documentary, the question was ignored, despite the door of opportunity to be swung wide open, in a large public venue thus having the near perfect position to lay out a rebuttal?

I can't speak for them. Maybe they hadn't seen it and didn't want to comment. Maybe the climate impact of the methane and factors like deforestation is substantial and they didn't want to comment on it.

It's a headache because the environment folks want it as a measure for monitoring devices they will put in the area that somehow link it to fishery safety standards. Ok that's  boring one. Another challenge is working on policy around vessel day licensing for foreign fishing vessels wanting tuna catch in our waters. Tuna is a wild species so control is essential to ensuring stocks are kept for the future so as you might imagine licenses are hard to come by to fish for a limited set of days. The Fisheries folks want to cash in on the licensing while conservation folks want strict limitation of both licenses and number of fishing days. The science is available and also provides guidance to best practice so we are in the middle trying to find the best policy grounds that provides some compromise between all interested parties.

As a person who works in software used to model things in the real world, I can tell you that the above quote is right on. All models of everything everywhere do eventually break when compared to enough real-world conditions, because truth is stranger than fiction. There are no perfect models.

However, the models that people have developed to try to understand the enormous, complex, chaotic system that we call 'climate' HAVE proven useful in some circumstances and HAVE predicted some big changes on earth (Greenland melting to an extent, glacier melts in some locales), and have missed some others (north pacific 'blob', antarctic ice volume).  Just because they aren't perfect, we don't throw them away. They are closer to predicting the future than throwing darts at a bingo card, for instance.

Belief in the untestable predictions of models is no different from religious belief. That's why the entire debate is couched in terms of belief. That's why the term ""denier"" is used (well, in addition to the fact that it is subconsciously associated with Holocaust denial). There are no ""deniers"" in actual fields of science because they can be shut up with actual repeatable experiment, the scientific method.

And the funniest part is that there is little difference in behavior between the believers and the ""deniers"". People who believe don't fly any less than those that don't.

Again, it's not. It makes dubious claims about off-the-cuff comments made by some people and media, and doesn't look at the actual science.

Nope. Man-made climate change is real, and AGW theory is supported by an ample body of evidence, among which are:

* The scientific fact of [CO2's greenhouse gas properties](http://spark.ucar.edu/carbon-dioxide-absorbs-and-re-emits-infrared-radiation)
* The fact that human activity has increased CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by about [40% over the past 160 years](http://iter.rma.ac.be/en/img/CO2-concenNEW_EN.jpg)
* The fact that [nights are warming up faster than days](http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/ar4/wg1/en/faq-3-3-figure-1.html)

* The fact that the tropopause - the boundary between the two - [has moved higher](http://www.math.nyu.edu/~gerber/pages/documents/santer_etal-science-2003.pdf)

No. Just no. Determining the source of greenhouse gasses in the environment has nothing to do with models. People measure radioisotopes of CO2 and methane in the atmosphere, compare to CO2 trapped in ice, carbon in petroleum, carbon from volcanoes, etc. Measurements have nothing to do with models.  

Measuring is reality. Measuring temperature, measuring CO2 ppm, measuring methane, that's reality. And reality shows a distinct warming trend in excess of all known historical and pre-historic norms, CO2 concentrations above any recent level, and human activity produces greenhouse gasses that can be **measured** to have the same isotopic make-up as a significant portion of gasses in the atmosphere.  

No modeling here. Just measurements.  Tons of data is available to show warming, to show increased CO2 and CH4 concentrations, to show the ability of these gasses to trap heat in laboratory conditions, to show the sources of GHG from volcanoes, factories, cows, etc... Data, data, data everywhere.  

You know what you can't find? Data that correlates solar output with average surface temperatures. Data that correlates volcanic output with the composition of GHG in the atmosphere. It's not that people didn't look, they have. As a scientist, if you really want to make a name for yourself, you disrupt scientific consensus, you disprove a prevailing theory. Pasteur, Salk, Copernicus, Einstein, these guys names will be remembered for centuries more because they blew the doors off some prevailing ideas.

That doesn't work for your theory. Carbon released from sources sequestered in oil/natural gas deposits will have a different isotopic composition from carbon from the biosphere.

So in your little world the solar input has no effect on the system and volcanos belching out the same gasses as our cows and our cars have different effects on the environment somehow.

That would be possible if the process wasn't political. In a field where the theories aren't independently testable the ""consensus"" is determined by politics, not the scientific method. Anyone presenting a different model will be shut down by the gatekeepers of the peer review process, who happen to have a vested interest in keeping the ""crisis"" alive.

""No matter if the science is all phony, there are collateral environmental benefits.... Climate change [provides] the greatest chance to bring about justice and equality in the world.""

Christine Stewart, former Minister of the Environment of Canada
quote from the Calgary Herald, 1999

At the present + 0.04C per decade trend taken from the last IPCC Report:
0.04C / 10 years = 0.004C per year
0.004C x 500 years = 2.0C

The UN and the IPCC have been paid dearly for these reports. To get our money's worth, the” might” happens, “could” occurs, and “maybes” should be compared to what the data says.
IPCC AR5 FINAL Ch. 9, p. 769, para.1Box 9.2 Climate Models and the Hiatus in Global Mean Surface Warming of the Past 15 Years “The observed global mean surface temperature (GMST) has shown a much smaller increasing linear trend over the past 15 years than over the past 30 to 60 years. Depending on the observational data set, the GMST trend over 1998–2012 is estimated to be around one-third to one-half of the trend over 1951–2012. For example, in HadCRUT4 the trend is 0.04ºC per decade over 1998–2012, compared to 0.11ºC per decade over 1951–2012.”

According to IPCC data, it will take 500 years for Earth to warm 2.0C.

I have made many contributions myself, and email/Vidyo is totally fine for the things I did where that was possible.  My commits were solely software commits.

That's nice. A first order approximation has nothing to do with the system itself.

It's not a linear system. Linear assumptions are not sufficient. Being aware of this doesn't make one a ""denier"". It makes someone who understands the basic math behind it.

Here, I'll start. Assertions I've made:

* due to increases in [greenhouse gasses ](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/images/science/GHGConc2000-large.jpg)

* primarily due to [human activity](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/science/causes.html)


Now if you read that last link very thoroughly, it does  a decent job of covering all the bases on this topic. You really shouldn't have too many big questions after reading that.  And no, there are no unverifiable models required to reach these three conclusions.

No, but there are unverifiable models required to go anywhere from there. This is been my objection all along. I would have no objection if there was the injection of a little modest doubt in the statements made by alarmists. If instead of ""the Earth will warm by X degrees if [some action] is not taken"" they said ""the Earth may warm by X degrees if [some action] is not taken"". But they can't do that because this is politics.

I haven't argued about measured surface temperature. I haven't argued about the absorption spectra of CO2 or methane. I have raised a slight objection to the notion that all or most of of this come from human activity but I don't care enough to argue it.

>As for your single advanced college class that convinced you that non-linear systems are difficult to model and we shouldn't even try, well, let's just set that aside for the moment.

Don't put words in my mouth, it's dishonest. I never said that. I said that a model of a non-linear system can be made to do whatever the hell one wants in the future while still reproducing past circumstances. ","{""2024-12-16T10:14:21"":1}",false,

Okay, so that's what you call 'raising a slight objection' ? Calling something a flat lie?

You've done a terrible job of making your objection clear. Really. I've re-read the thread several times and it's obvious you have this conversation on a repeating basis. May I suggest you start all future conversations by clearly and unequivocally stating this up front?   

>  would have no objection if there was the injection of a little modest doubt in the statements made by alarmists.  

So, the fact that sooo many of the scientific statements issues have caveats like 'if current trend continues' or 'lacking another agent or effect to explain *x*' littered all over their introductions and conclusions just isn't good enough?  
> alarmists  

Maybe the problem here is headlines/news reporting, which is generally terrible for understanding science. Check out the actual papers behind the headlines, ignore the caterwauling of the 'journalists' before you dismiss the concerns of those people who are working most closely with the data.

>>>climategate emails  

[Climategate has been thoroughly debunked](http://www.skepticalscience.com/Climategate-CRU-emails-hacked.htm), you really shouldn't bring it up. It just hurts your credibility.

> this is politics  

Yes, there is politiking involved in this. And in some ways, that's inevitable, because any attempt to decrease GHG's will absolutely require changes in policies. That's because GHG's are **actively encouraged** under current policies.  

It really comes down to this: warming is occurring, due to increases in GHG, primarily from human activity. You've just stated you have a 'slight' objection to the last bit because there are other sources of GHG (true but they aren't increasing their output), so I assume you are otherwise on-board with this statement?  

And it appears self-evident that too much warming of the earth's surface will be massively disruptive to human civilization.  

The 2 questions then become: how warm is too warm, and can we stop the warming before we get too warm?  

Agreed so far?

Honestly it's hard to keep track of who I'm talking to because every time this comes up it spawns a hornet's nest of partisan hate and a bunch of people saying the same thing to me. I haven't reviewed the thread because I really don't care at this point but I don't recall this not being my objection.

No. And statements like ""the science is settled"" or the use of the word ""incontrovertible"" are still used, and they're utterly unscientific.

>Check out the actual papers behind the headlines, ignore the caterwauling of the 'journalists' before you dismiss the concerns of those people who are working most closely with the data.

I have. The actual reports are political and unscientific in their claims.

>Climategate has been thoroughly debunked

One hand washes the other. Reading the e-mails shows a thorough corruption of the peer review process, despite the denial of groups that have a political interest in continuing the alarmism. Given that repeatable experiment is not possible, the corruption of the peer review process is very damning.

>That's because GHG's are actively encouraged under current policies. 

>so I assume you are otherwise on-board with this statement? 

Yes. However, my objection is that the trend will not necessarily continue.

>And it appears self-evident that too much warming of the earth's surface will be massively disruptive to human civilization. 

No, it doesn't. And the ridiculous exaggeration and doomsday scenarios promoted by alarmists don't help their credibility.

>The 2 questions then become: how warm is too warm, and can we stop the warming before we get too warm? 

And the answers are: ""we don't know"" and ""yes, we could have prevented a good amount of GHG emissions with policy decades ago but the same people who are hyping this opposed the one feasible non-carbon source of energy and we got 30 years of coal, oil, and gas generation instead so their credibility is not that great"".","{""2024-12-16T10:14:22"":1}",false,

> Waste is a non issue.

The only way I can see that being true is if we store everything deep underground.

But my guess is, that's really expensive; . . . After a quick Google search, I find one paper estimating a cost of $15 million to drill an appropriate borehole.

That's a scary-sounding number. Sure, it's practically insignificant next to the cost of a new reactor, but people are always going to be looking for ways to save money. And even if it's less costly in the long run . . . well, if we were good at taking long-term costs into account, maybe we would have dealt with climate change *before* it started becoming an existential threat.

And even if we assume that *storage* is a non-issue, *transportation* will always have associated risks.

> Fuel is also a non issue.

The *known* fuel supplies can only last on the order of 100-200 years, and that's at current consumption rates. Theoretically, there's more than enough uranium in the world to last effectively forever -- but could our discovery and production rates keep pace with massively increased consumption? And how much of can we reasonably be expected to recover, ever? Suffice to say, I'm skeptical of claims that we could run on nuclear for tens of thousands of years.","{""2024-12-16T10:20:50"":1}",false,

We should still be building them 100%, however newer reactors will have no chance of melting down and will have none of those issues. The only issue is cost, however that's misleading. All energy solutions are going to be insanely expensive. If you're against nuclear, and support the environment, then you're hypocritical. A lot of these renewable people are spouting their same political jargon about overpopulation this, or overpopulation that.

I'm going to have to object on this point. More carbon is pulled out of the lithosphere from fossil fuels and the like, turned into CO2 among other things and part of that is absorbed into the food cows eat. It's not a closed cycle but an open one. 

>Yes, but that CO2 was already there before being absorbed by crops, eaten by the cow, and remitted. Only the time spent as methane adds more heat than it otherwise would have.

[Cute video from the World Wildlife Foundation explaining COP21 and why it is important](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jOjEJq_fMw)

[Website for the conference](http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en/learn/what-is-cop21/)

- Summary of information: 

The conference will be an important step in coming to an international agreement, through the UN, on establishing emmissions targets over the next decade. Top scientists and policy analysist around the world picked 2°C of warming as a target, since they felt is was low enough to avoid some catastrophic effects, but high enough to be attainable. 

- Some additional information: 

Taking the attitude of fatalism (""we can't do it"") is utterly unhelpful and untrue. It is actually economically beneficial, especially in terms of long-term investments, for each nation to become more environmental and sustainable in their practices. The impacts of not acting will be felt on the ecosphere (we are in the middle of a mass extinction), economy (for example, China is losing billions in GDP due to air pollution alone), health, and security (whether that be national security, food security, or otherwise). 

- What can I do? 

Take a look at these resources and do some searching of your own. Being informed is very important! In addition, there are some things that you can do on a daily basis that will not take big changes in your routine. Consider: 

1. Eating less or no meat. Try having a meatless Monday or buying only locally raised animal products. 

2. Vote with your ballot and your wallet. Buy products like coffee or chocolate with a Rainforest Alliance ""follow the frog"" sticker. Vote in favor of the environment come election day. 

3. Get informed about climate change. Check your sources when you are reading, as well. The IPCC is the leading authority on climate information because it combines the collaborative work of the top scientists and analysist from around the world.

Agreed with your point in general, but it's more clear if you just talk in real terms rather than financial. Society ""pays for"" the unproductive elderly in terms of real goods & services.

We have government loans that won't need to be payed for until the next generation, that we're spending today.

When you take a loan to buy a house, do you need a time machine, or do you spend less money than you otherwise could have?

More importantly though, even if you believe in Keynesianism, even according to that dogma, staying near the zero lower bound pretty much fucks the feds ability to ""correct"" the economy. Causing a liquidity trap and neutering their ability to stimulate. All that fun stuff. So no, you can't go on 0% forever. 

>This whole tangent of your replies is an example of why we shouldn't bring money into things, because people are confused. Most come to absolutely terrible conclusions because they can't conceive of a macro economy, and use mental framing that they're used to (which leads to ""how 2 pay for"" uncertainty, and 'government = household' analogy).

You're basically saying I'm wrong because you're right. A lot of people are confused, sure, but I suspect you're among them. ","{""2024-12-16T09:58:50"":1}",false,

The more debt the government issues, the more we are holding as financial assets. Whether that's in the form of cash, reserves, or treasury securities, it doesn't matter and is interchangeable: our balance sheet assets and the government's balance sheet liabilities are two sides of the same coin.

> When you take a loan to buy a house, do you need a time machine, or do you spend less money than you otherwise could have?

Ok great, so you came right out and declared the government = household analogy anyway. When you or I issue an IOU (taking out a loan, going into debt, etc.), it's actually a promise to pay something. The government issues IOUs (cash, reserves, treasury securities) that only promise to pay *other* government IOUs, or nothing at all. And people happily work hard for those IOUs that promise to pay nothing, and hold them as savings. And if the government chooses to pay interest on those IOUs, then they can always do so as much as they want, and issue more IOUs for the interest payments. Is this starting to sound different from you or me taking out a loan?

The mainstream New Keynesians and their liquidity trap stuff is messed up too, but it's off topic. The central bank doesn't fine-tune the economy (although they wish they could) so it doesn't matter to me if they lose what they consider to be a stimulative tool from monetary policy (ability to lower rates). Making fiscal policy subservient to monetary policy is an ideological premise that stems from the same anti-government/politician viewpoint. The point is that they're free to set 0% rates if they so choose (and they've been close to 0% for seven years already). Interest on base government liabilities is a subsidy to savers, a policy choice. It's not stealing from our non-existent great-grandchildren, or forcing them to work in sweatshops sending goods & services back in time 50 yrs.","{""2024-12-16T09:58:50"":1}",false,

We've known for a long time, and have kept mostly inactive. We know the problem comes mostly form energy, and we have had a source of abundant energy with low GHG emissions for all this time, but the people caring about the planet were and still are against it.

Some others are making vast effort to [get rid of it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_sector_in_Germany#/media/File:Electricity_Production_in_Germany.svg) in priority, in effect deciding that climate change is a secondary issue.

Sorry for the rant.  
Possible decisions that you should keep an eye on: how binding (ie what if a party does not meet its commitments)? is nuclear among the technologies to recommend (time for the bitter medicine)? how to avoid green washing, like ""I've got 20% of solar panels to hide my coal plants behind""?  
Anything other than that will be wishful thinking to help us sleep at night, thinking we are doing something useful (until COP31).

> concernant les récents événements le sujet restera t'il bien concentré sur la situation climatique de notre planète ou risque t'il de déborder sur des débats politiques ?

Pour la conférence elle-même, elle portera sur les sujets prévus : le mandat de négociation a été défini il y a 3 ans et il y a déjà eu beaucoup de discussions... On ne peut pas changer l'ordre d'un tel événement diplomatique en deux semaines.

Plus largement, pour le débat dans la société, c'est un peu à double tranchant : d'un coté, il y a la tentation de se concentrer sur le court-terme et la réponse au terrorisme. De l'autre, ça conduit aussi à se poser des questions sur le rôle du changement climatique dans la destabilisation de la Syrie (la guerre civile a été précédée de 3 ans d'une sécheresse exceptionnelle).

Pour moi les deux sujets ne sont pas forcément en contradiction : limiter le déréglement climatique et mieux gérer nos ressources en énergie, c'est une plutôt bonne façon de construire un monde plus stable...","{""2024-12-16T10:04:23"":10}",false,

Je n'ai pas d'opinion sur le sujet mais il y a des arguments qui ressortent assez souvent dont je peux te faire part.

Pour la première partie de ta réponse:

Pour certains, la ville durable ne devrait pas être une norme mais un projet construit collectivement. Faire autrement, ça serait aller à l'encontre du développement durable (le développement durable ne se réduisant pas à son volet environnemental).
De plus, forcer les gens à vivre ensemble mènerait à des situations soit de ségrégation sociale soit de mixité forcée. Or la mixité forcée amène rarement à des situations de voisinages paisibles et agréables.

Beaucoup de gens veulent avoir leur maison individuelle, leur jardin, et leur barbecue. Leur imposer autre chose c'est encore aller contre le projet collectif de ville durable. 

J'imagine que l'habitat participatif serait une bonne réponse pour concilier les intérêts de chacun, malgré un risque de ségrégation.


Pour la seconde partie de ta réponse :

Complètement d'accord pour les crédits d'impôt.

* Il y a de vrais problèmes environnementaux et sanitaires autour de l'élevage en particulier bovin.

* Les émissions de gaz à effet de serre sont généralement exprimées en équivalent carbone à 100 ans ce qui conduit à sous-évaluer les émissions de méthane qui viennent en grande partie de l'élevage (pour plus de détails, [j'en ai parlé ici](http://www.euractiv.fr/sections/climat-environnement/reduire-les-emissions-de-methane-pour-limiter-le-dereglement))

>Fun fact : l'idée que l'effet de serre serait proche saturation est, à ma connaissance, le plus vieil argument climatosceptique.

C'est simplement la loi de Beer-Lambert-Bouguer : il y a un effet de saturation, la question est de savoir où l'on se trouve par rapport à cette saturation.

Par ailleurs, je n'aime pas trop cette appélation de ""climatosceptique"". Je dénonce plutôt une rhétorique ""tout CO2"" qu'on voit dans les médias. Je ne dis pas non plus que c'est mal de simplifier voire de mentir, je ne parle pas des autres effets d'emballement climatique.

> Aujourd'hui, nous avons des moyens de mesures qui confirment qu'une concentration plus importante en CO2 dans l'atmosphère conduit à retenir plus de chaleur

Je n'ai pas dit l'inverse, j'ai dit que lors du dernier rapport du GIEC, les modèles avaient été révisés à la baisse (c'est un fait) notamment parce qu'ils avaient surestimé les augmentations liées au CO2.

Dans le [4ème rapport du GIEC](http://www.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/GIECDOC_INTERNET.pdf), ils parlaient d'une augmentation de  1,1°C à 6,4°C d’ici 2100. Dans le 5ème, ce n'est plus qu'une augmentation comprise entre [0,3 °C et 4,8 °C](http://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2014/04/14/rechauffement-les-dix-points-marquants-du-rapport-du-giec_4399907_3244.html).

L'augmentation de température est plus faible que prévue, notamment parce que la loi de Beer-Lambert-Bouguer : le flux des radiations infrarouges absorbé **décroit de façon exponentielle en fonction de l'augmentation de la concentration dans l'atmosphère du gaz à effet de serre**.

Attention, je ne mets pas en doute l'augmentation de température, je me demande juste si le discours centré sur le CO2 n'est pas une simplification destinée à convaincre la plèbe (évidemment, trouver une cause unique à un phénomène complexe, c'est beaucoup plus facile que d'expliquer l'immense bordel qu'est le climat).","{""2024-12-16T10:04:55"":1}",false,

>le lait c'est fait pour transformer un veau en vache

Juste parce que quand on souligne que boire/consommer du lait c'est pas fait pour nous mais pour le veau, sans remettre en question si les produits laitiers sont adaptés ou pas pour nous car je n'en sais rien pour être honnête et je sais même pas si on a une réponse définitive, étant donné que la vache actuelle produit bien plus que ce que le veau nécessite, y'a que le côté nutritionnel qu'on peut remettre en question. Même si la production de lait est énergétiquement intensive pour la vache et que du coup elle bouffe.. 

Enfin bref c'est surtout que cet argument qu'on entend souvent (milk is for veal) n'est pas tout à fait vrai, disons qu'il ne faut pas y voir une privation du veau en tout cas.

> manger un hamburger est équivalent à prendre une douche pendant 2 mois (2500 litres d'eau)

une vache ça boit 30-50 L d'eau par jour, et ça mange 50kg de mais par jour. Je te laisse imaginer combien de flotte le maïs nécessite dans les zones sèches type la californie. Oh, et aussi, ce petit cirque dure deux ans minimum avant que tu la manges. Donc ouais.

 > n'est-ce pas hypocrite de concentrer les enjeux écologiques autour du ""climat"" et d'une vision comptable en voulant limiter les émissions de CO2?

Clairement, il y a eu des dérives (notamment dans le cadre des mécanismes de développement propres mis en place par le protocole de Kyoto). Depuis 2000 on est sorti progressivement de cette logique et aujourd'hui la question du climat est traitée en relation avec d'autres problèmes environnementaux et sociaux (réduction de la pauvreté, faim, océans...).

Un glacier en l'occurence. Et non sourcé.

> les évènements climatiques ne deviennent pas plus extremes au contraire (nombre d'ouragans en baisse aux US, nombre de tornades en baisse, vagues de chaleur en baisse, ect)

D'une manière générale, la plupart des modèles climatiques ne prévoient pas une augmentation de la fréquence des événements climatique extrèmes mais une augmentation de leur gravité. Ex : [le nombre d'ouragans est stable mais le nombre d'ouragans de catégorie 4 ou 5 a fortement augmenté](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/309/5742/1844.short).

> le climat a été plus chaud dans un passé récent (du moins au Groenland)

Nope, l'optimum climatique médiéval auquel vous faites référence correspondait à [une augmentation de la température moyenne de 0.5°C, avec une augmentation particulièrement forte dans l'Atlantique Nord](http://www.meteo.psu.edu/holocene/public_html/shared/articles/MannetalScience09.pdf). La température au Groenland était à peu près équivalente à celle qu'on y connait actuellement.

> la banquise semble fondre dans un passé récent, mais seulement au nord, tandis qu'au sud

Pas non plus. [Seul l'Antartique Est gagne de la glace (banquise et calotte) mais pas assez pour compenser les pertes sur le reste du continent](http://www.ess.uci.edu/researchgrp/erignot/files/science-2012-shepherd-1183-9.pdf) mais ça n'empèche que même dans cette région [la température de l'éair et de l'océan augmente](http://psc.apl.washington.edu/zhang/Pubs/Zhang_Antarctic_20-11-2515.pdf). L'explication est à chercher ailleurs, essentiellement une augmentation des précipitations (qui entraine la formation de glace sur le continent) et du vent (qui favorise la formation de banquise).

> J'ai juste l'impression que pour les particulier, la consommation électrique pendant la phase d'utilisation est assez anecdoctique comparée aux impacts environnementaux de la production, de la distribution et du recyclage.

Ça m'amène à te poser une nième question: quid de l'obsolescence programmée dans les matériels électroniques actuels (et dans les logiciels qui les font tourner, du système d'exploitation aux logiciels ""grand public"")? 

Exemple: Mon vieil amiga 1200 fonctionne toujours, il a 23 ans, il tourne sous NetBSD et il est encore utile (backports, tests de perfs, etc), je ne suis pas sûr que mon smartphone fonctionnera dans 20 ans, et encore moins qu'il pourra être utile. 

Est-ce que ce sujet sera abordé lors de la COP21? Parceque le cycle de renouvellement des matériels types smartphones/tablettes est quand même assez hallucinant, surtout au vu de leur utilisation limitée (surf, mails, chat, réseaux sociaux, GPS… et picétout©) et de leur potentiel créatif encore plus limité (impossible de coder raisonnablement là dessus, systèmes fermés ne favorisant pas l'apprentissage ""par la bidouille"", etc) alors que ces périphériques sont aussi puissants que des PCs d'il y a ~10 ans. 

Le pire étant qu'ils sont *construits* pour être remplacés (batteries soudées, pas de possibilité d'évolution, réparations difficiles - par exemple changement d'écran, etc). Y'a pas beaucoup de gâchis là dessus, tant en terme de ressources que d'éducation?

Le gros problème de ce film quand il attribue la responsabilité du changement climatique à l'élevage, c'est qu'il ne fait pas un bilan honnête: il ne tient pas compte d'où vient le carbone de l'élevage. 

Le méthane (où plutôt le carbone) produit par l'élevage fait partie du cycle naturel: Il vient de l'air, du sol et de l'eau, est transformé en composés organiques, puis est rejeté sous forme de méthane, CO2 ou composés organiques dans l'air (respiration, ""pets de vaches"") ou le sol (y compris tous les déchets organiques, les bouts de peau, l'urine, les matières fécales). Oui, l'élevage accélère la portion du cycle qui rejette du méthane, et au lieu d'avoir le cycle stable que la nature a créé, on a décalé l'équilibre vers plus de CO2 dans l'atmosphère. Mais l'élevage consomme tout autant de carbone (de l'air, de l'eau et du sol) qu'il en rejette.

**La** grosse différence avec l'industrie, par exemple le charbon ou le pétrole, c'est qu'elle ne fait que produire du CO2: dans le sens où elle va le puiser dans des mines et le libère dans l'atmosphère. Ce CO2 ne faisait pas partie du cycle naturel, l'industrie l'y ajoute simplement. Bien entendu, ce CO2 pourrait éventuellement avoir jailli dans l'atmosphère par un volcan, une source hydrothermale ou autre, mais sur des échelles de temps géologiques, donc beaucoup plus grandes.
 
-----

**TLDR**: L'industrie c'est pire parce que ca relâche du carbone enfoui, alors que l'élevage ça ne fait qu'accéler une partie du cycle naturel de la biologie, sans rajouter de carbone.","{""2024-12-16T10:04:29"":1}",false,

j'aimerais bien que les gens arrêtent de raconter de la merde. je l'ai déjà écrit ailleurs mais j'ai la flemme d'aller chercher mon post mais c'est des putains de conneries anthropomorphistes et ça m'énerve

les races laitières sont pas maternelles du tout donc la vache elle s'en branle

le veau il boit le colostrum de sa mere et ensuite du lait de vache random (y'a tjrs une ou deux vaches dont le lait ne va pas à la consommation humaine temporairement et l'éleveur leur refile)

d'autre part d'un point de vue hygiénique, c'est bien mieux d'avoir des veaux isolés, dans un lieu plus à l'abri, pas dans la merde et tous les pathogenes des 100 autres vaches (et ceux des autres veaux au passage). ah et aussi ça évite qu'il se fasse marcher dessus, déjà que ça arrive parfois au vêlage... et c'est plus facile à surveiller aussi.

Mais svp arrêtez de raconter n'importe quoi et répandre la sottise cf ton premier paragraphe ! C'est des arguments à la con qui n'ont absolument aucun fondement mais comme plus personne n'a vu une vache dans sa vie désormais ça marche.

Quant au devenir des veaux ben oui c'est pas glamour mais en même temps tu vas pas foutre la viande que tu as produite à la poubelle...

Et le réchauffement climatique a aussi été plus faible que prévu. L'une des raisons pour lesquelles on a changé de scénarios et de modèles, c'est qu'on s'était plantés avant.

Que quasiment personne ne tique à propos du fait que ce serait l'élevage qui est la principale cause du réchauffement climatique, ça me tue (mais je pense que c'est un facteur important, hein, quand même) quand on pense que notre principale source d'énergie permettant d'alimenter notre économie c'est de fait l'emploi d'énergies fossiles, soit de littéralement brûler des composés carbonés. Pour se déplacer, déplacer des tonnes et des tonnes de marchandises, alimenter la production de milliards d'objets, se chauffer... C'est d'ailleurs assez nombriliste pour nous côté occidentaux de penser que c'est l'élevage qui serait le principal problème quand on sait qu'une bonne partie de la population a des habitudes de consommation carnée beaucoup plus faibles et que donc l'élevage lui-même est moins pertinent pour d'autres (et qu'il serait tout de même la cause principale du réchauffement?). Soit dit en passant et pour nuancer rapidement mon propos, s'ils se mettent à consommer de la viande comme nous, ce qu'on pourrait pas nécessairement leur reprocher, on risque d'avoir un problème exacerbé, et la consommation de viande doit quand même tendre vers la réduction.

J'en ai juste ras le bol des simplifications, des contre-vérités, des biais, et dès qu'on cherche à s'informer dans pleins de sujets on est enfoui dans une sorte de tourbillon de contre-vérités des deux côtés, dont l'adhésion à l'un ou l'autre est finalement plus motivé par des idéologies sous-jacentes ou à une manipulation par des intérêts particuliers qu'une analyse des faits.
Là par exemple, je suis presque sûr que la composante éthique rentre largement en ligne de compte, avec des gens qui considèrent que consommer de la viande est immoral (ce qui est peut être pas totalement faux...c'est peut être un des trucs sur lesquels les générations futures nous condamnerons comme on le fait aujourd'hui avec l'esclavage par exemple...) et qui ajoutent plein d'arguments plus ou moins vrais, pour essayer de persuader les gens qui n'adhèrent pas à leur postulat de base.

J'ai essayé de m'informer un peu sur tout ce qui est alimentation, nutrition, parce que je fais du sport et que j'ai envie de m'étoffer et que j'ai des problèmes assez chiants de santé en rapport avec la digestion de la bouffe. J'ai lu des tonnes et des tonnes d'avis contraires, vu au cours de ma formation (sans rapport avec mon tropisme pour la nutrition) que des entreprises financent des ONG pour lutter contre des produits qui leur font concurrence (le ""lait c'est pour les veaux"" c'est un exemple, j'ai vu des liens entre l'industrie des compléments alimentaires et des laits végétaux, avec des ONG déblatérant de débilités la-dessus) et ma conclusion c'est qu'arrêter de manger de la viande au vu de l'état de la science actuelle dessus (spoiler alert, on est au niveau semi-débutant sur ce sujet) c'est vraiment prendre des risques. La viande contient plein de nutriments spécifiques, est un composant de l'alimentation normal pour des omnivores dont nous faisons partie, et manger équilibré en partant du principe qu'on passe à côté de rien nécessite un investissement de temps et d'argent dans la bouffe accessible à guère qu'une minorité privilégiée de la population.

I don't think we can go further with persuasion. Science is overwhelming and Europe is already demonstrating that emissions reduction does not imply economic disaster. 

Obviously, we can't do much without the US (because in that case developing countries wouldn't accept any effort). As a result, I believe European negotiators are prepared to tailor-made an agreement that fit the US (one key issue being to avoid a veto by the Senate).

Je ne discute pas du tout de toutes les problématiques additionnelles de l'élevage intensif, je suis tout autant contre, mais c'est un autre sujet. Les mentionner ne constitue absolument pas un argument contre ce que j'ai écris plus haut. À part, peut-être, la déforestation. Mais la déforestation n'est pas prise en compte dans le bilan erroné que fait le documentaire sur la contribution directe de l'élevage (les pets de vaches) comme étant plus importante que les industries.

Honnêtement léger ? Je fais un bilan honnête justement. Je ne mets pas de processus sous le tapis. Je tiens une argumentation logique solide que tu évites avec sarcasme et dédain, mais sans argument. Le film 'Cowspiracy', que j'ai regardé, pour lequel il faut payer (ahem), mets des processus sous le tapis quand il fait ses bilans: que ce soit pour l'eau pour faire un burger (dont la partie recyclée est habilement esquivée), ou pour le CO2 rejetté par les vaches. La quantité de CO2 rejetté par les volcans fait partie d'un cycle aussi, stable avant l'humanité: il y a autant de CO2 continuellement enfoui de manière naturelle que de CO2 sortant des volcans, des geysers, des sources hydrothermales. L'activité humaine perturbe les cycles du CO2 en augmentant une portion des flux de ces cycles. Pour ce qui est de l'élevage, c'est un cycle qui se compte en siècles. Pour les cycles géologiques, c'est en millions d'années. Et les effets de la perturbation humaine, pour ce qui est des quantités de CO2 dans l'atmosphère, à flux égal, est moindre pour l'élevage que pour l'industrie. Ne pas comprendre ces subtilités et les ignorer, c'est une erreur. Quand un volcan érupte, il y a un processus équivalent pour en annuler (lentement) les effets, c'est la conséquence des milliards d'années d'évolution de la terre vers un équilibre plutôt stable géologiquement parlant. Quand une industrie coule du béton bitumineux aussi vite que les volcans il faut attendre des durées géolgiques pour que la terre retrouve un équilibre stable, à un niveau de CO2 augmenté.

Je ne suis pas négationiste, je suis un matheux qui bosse dans l'océanographie et qui étudie des cycles d'éléments, de nutriments (comme le carbone, l'azote, le phosphore, le fer, le silicium) complexes et leurs réactions aux perturbations climatiques et environnementales. Et il y un type d'erreur qui est souvent commis quand on attribue la responsabilité d'une perturbation. Ce type d'erreur c'est un bilan incomplet, ou une attribution en anomalie parfois douteuse. Dans le cas du documentaire, c'est un bilan incomplet.

Si tu veux faire du bien à l'environnement, et que tu es d'un pays développé, la priorité pour toi n'est certainement pas de réduire ta consommation de viande.

Avant d'arrêter de consommer de la viande, il faut arrêter de consommer les 'biens' qui font plus de dégats. ","{""2024-12-16T10:05:05"":1}",true,

> Climate vs economic growth
Particularly since the economic crisis, powerful lobbies like BusinessEurope (the European federation of employers’ organisations) have positioned climate action as directly opposed to economic growth. The EU’s climate and energy targets for 2030 reflected this, not just lacking ambition but prioritising the competitiveness of the very industries causing climate change.

> The result is that governments are afraid to tackle climate change for fear of upsetting industry, or when they do, polluting industries are given huge taxpayer-funded handouts.

In that, it will serve some purpose - give some indication. However I would strongly suggest a far stronger exploration of the whole issue - dig far deeper and broader - there is a lot going on and skimming over the surface will not address all the issues.

Just a few comments on the survey :-

1) it doesn't distinguish 'climate change' from 'global warming' - ie. it doesn't address 'global cooling', - it just makes assumptions.

2) it doesn't distinguish between public investment and private investment.

3) Carbon Capture and Storage Technology - well we already have that - plants, trees etc. . Why not maximise them? - green the Sahara -> feed the poor - etc.?

4) Solar Radiation Management - geoengineering? - not necessary.


Generally there is very little public support for warmism etc. . One huge reason for this is that the public are very suspicious about what is going on. Another huge reason is that their experience of the reality on the ground is very different from what they see in the media.

If the warmists are saying one thing is happening to the world's climate and mother nature has alternate ideas where does that leave the warmists? This is the whole nub of the issue - science is supposed to be objective - non partisan. It is supposed to use the scientific method and to follow the trail of evidence. It is supposed to be professional, to have probity and integrity. And it is not supposed to make gods out of humans.","{""2024-12-16T10:34:15"":4}",true,

If you want to know what caused warmer and cooler historical climatic fluctuations, most evidence points to changes in solar intensity. We know that the sun's influence on the global climate over the past 50 years should be causing a cooling effect, and yet global temps have risen alongside atmospheric greenhouse gases... which have a known, measurable warming effect.

Actually, there's plenty of work being done to account for climate change when planning new infrastructure. Unfortunately, a lot of it depends on funding from national government, which is subject to the whims of politics, which is why funding for things like flood defenses and energy efficiency improvements in new housing has been cut under this government, against the advice of the major professional institutions.","{""2024-12-16T10:25:11"":3}",false,

Cette surface est exprimée en hectaresglobaux (hag), c´est-à-dire en hectares ayant une productivité égale à la productivité moyenne

Le problème c'est que c'est très violent, voir choquant. Je voulais mettre en perspective les décisions qui seront (ou ne seront pas) prises dans les jours à venir sur une échelle de temps longue.

Les problèmes climitiques on en parle depuis que suis petit, quelque part la génération future à qui on doit léguer une planète propre elle est déjà là. Pourtant, après m'être intéressé à la question je constate que malgré les différentes idées, preuves et solutions proposées la direction n'a pas changé. 

J'ai donc essayé d'imaginer ce qu'il pourrait se passer demain si la génération future en question arrivait au pouvoir et constatait avec horreur que leurs prédéceceurs auraient pu mais n'ont pas fait grand chose. C'est là qu'est apparu l'idée d'une sorte de grand procès pour juger les personnes ""responsables"" de ce désastre, chargées des accusations ""crime contre l'humanité - crime contre la biodiversité - crime contre l'environnement"". C'est pour répondre à ces chefs d'accusation que les ""condamnés à mort"" sont apparus.

Maintenant c'est assez délicat, parce que le message véhiculé est très négatif. Mais en même temps les conséquences annoncées le sont également. C'était avant tout un moyen de mettre un ""coup de pression"" aux politiques qui visiblement n'est pas de très bon goût vis-à-vis des remarques et des votes que j'ai reçu.

Unfortunately, the way many places are designed it would be impossible to switch to public transport, walking or cycling without a significant decline in quality of life. Think about those in rural or low density suburban areas, the car is king here for a reason - the alternates are poor. Even if we could make these places public transport friendly, by that time extreme climate change would already be a reality.

Instead I think governments should focus on making new communities sustainable and transit friendly (as well as improving exiting ones) and implement a price on carbon. Pricing carbon would make transit more attractive and driving less attractive. ","{""2024-12-16T10:36:17"":11}",false,

But I understand enough of it to see the point it is making and by reading it and the intermediate section side by side the article becomes clearer.  
It is not the only article I have read and its safe to say that I have seen more in the last 12 hours than I saw in the previous 12 months. Some are intelligent and well argued whilst others are just rants.   
I have been finding articles supporting natural climate change to show you, there are many by well respected people and institutions (and a few flawed/over simplistic ones from less respected sources) but I decided against it.  I don't see the point in trading links, we are both busy and have better things to do. Instead I will point you to your own link. At the bottom of that article are 24 pages of discussion containing intelligent counter arguments and rebuttal (and common insults), which are in turn countered.  
  
You (politely) and others on here (less politely) are presenting Climate Change as a result of Greenhouse Gases as an established fact, it is not. The debate on that article (and others) is on going and carried out by people on all sides who are far more intelligent than I am. The fact that there are conferences like the ones happening today shows that not everybody is convinced. 

Because the debate in the scientific community is on-going the political/economic community are unwilling to act, and neither am I.   
I still believe Climate Change is a natural process and nothing I have read alters that. Greenhouse gases almost certainly are a factor and may have been in the past (from whatever sources) but the Earth has coped/changed/adapted and we as occupants of it must do the same. I would be very interested to research how the Earth regulated itself after previous changes and if those mechanisms are still in place but that would have to be on a part time basis as I am a working man and not a climate change researcher.  
I do think we as a species have to change our way of living, we are strip mining resources and investing little into sustainable living. But for me that's not a climate change issue, its a continuing to live on a limited planet issue.  
.  
I think the final truth is somewhere in between. Climates change naturally but that change is probably being affected by current actions of mankind. For me the bigger issue is not the prevention of that but rather the accepting and accommodating our lifestyle around it.   The Earth will continue and we should adapt to it. If an increase in overall temperature changes weather patterns to the extent that certain areas become uninhabitable then we should vacate those areas and allow the natural checks and balances of the Earth to continue.

Wow. That's quite a cop out. A complete unwillingness to engage in a scientific debate around climate change is an unfortunate tendency of so-called sceptics.

> You are presenting Climate Change as a result of Greenhouse Gases as an established fact

No, I'm presenting it as a theory that best explains the current warming trend, as supported by an extensive base of observed evidence and detailed physical modelling of the climate system.

> Because the debate in the scientific community is on-going the political/economic community are unwilling to act, and neither am I.

No, the consensus among the political/economic community is that action must be taken to avoid the harmful consequences of climate change, and much is already being done. Your lack of awareness of the range of activities already underway to reduce global emissions does not justify your own lack of action. The only serious debate that is ongoing is over the level of response that is needed.

> I still believe Climate Change is a natural process and nothing I have read alters that.

Based on what? Where is the evidence to support the belief that the current warming trend is natural?

> Greenhouse gases almost certainly are a factor and may have been in the past (from whatever sources) but the Earth has coped/changed/adapted and we as occupants of it must do the same.

Sure, and one of the ways we can adapt is by reducing our levels of GHG emissions.

> I would be very interested to research how the Earth regulated itself after previous changes and if those mechanisms are still in place but that would have to be on a part time basis as I am a working man and not a climate change researcher.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_feedback#Negative

> Climates change naturally but that change is probably being affected by current actions of mankind.

Yes, that's precisely what the scientific consensus claims - the main conclusion of the IPCC assessment report is that at least 50% of the warming observed since 1950 is due to human activity.

> For me the bigger issue is not the prevention of that but rather the accepting and accommodating our lifestyle around it.  The Earth will continue and we should adapt to it.

Sure, and part of that lifestyle change will include reducing our emissions.

> If an increase in overall temperature changes weather patterns to the extent that certain areas become uninhabitable then we should vacate those areas and allow the natural checks and balances of the Earth to continue.

It's not so much about areas becoming uninhabitable, it's about the impact it will have on the global economy. Major natural disasters have a significant economic cost alongside the tragic human cost, and the impact that a warming climate is going to have on businesses with long-term outlooks is making a lot of people sit up and take notice. That's why the IPCC present their reports as assessments of risk, because that's how the global political/economic community judge what the appropriate level of response should be.

2. China: 105,915 MT or 9.0%
3. Russia: 94,679 MT or 8.0%

10. Ukraine: 25,431 MT or 2.2%

Here is another interesting bit:

>**Consumption footprints**

>Imported and exported goods add another layer of complexity to the equation. Many commentators argue that focusing on where emissions are produced is unfair, **because much of the carbon output of countries such as China are generated as a result of producing goods that are ultimately consumed in richer nations. If emissions are measured in terms of consumption rather than production (that is, each country's exports are excluded from its footprint, and its imports added) the tables turn yet again.**

This leads to arguably the best measure of current responsibility for climate change: the total carbon footprint of the average person in each nation.

Getting people of all ages to work pushing for real change on our environmental laws. Corporations are raping the earth for profit, stopping them will do so much more then everyone switching to LED light bulbs ever could. 

http://www.nrdc.org/legislation/

We need to cut the fluff from going green. We're told making minor, non impactful changes in our lives are making a difference on the environment which simply isn't true. Getting educated on what the REAL and BIGGEST contributors to climate change are is one of the most important things you can do with your young daughter in my opinion. We need more people who are willing to educate other and for that you must be educated yourself.

Can protocol and equipment be improved- absolutely. Biologists are constantly trying to find less invasive methods, and improve invasive techniques.

I don't know about polar bears, but capture clearly has a negative effect on grizzly and black bears:
http://jmammal.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/4/973.full

Being captured was linked to elevated AST values indicating injury, and reduced movement for the next 3-6 weeks. Repeated capturing was linked to reduced body condition as an animal ages -- sounds like something that can have a real (negative) impact on an animal's life.
On the other hand, I have read cases where captured animals had festering injuries (caused by something else) that were treated, and then healed promptly. This is probably much less common, but I did want to point out that being captured has also occasionally helped the animal.
I have also read of bears that are trapped far more than expected. Perhaps those individuals reason it is worth it for the food, and are also likely to stay calm through it all and thus not hurt themselves.

You said three published studies found no impact in polar bears; why the difference between them and the other North American bear species? Are they simply much more calm, and thus unlikely to hurt themselves?","{""2024-12-16T10:18:12"":25}",false,

and with so much purposeful deception from those like AlGore on this issue, and with solid evidence that we are in a new decade-long cooling trend as well (http://www.express.co.uk/news/science/616937/GLOBAL-COOLING-Decade-long-ice-age-predicted-as-sun-hibernates ) that the global warming alarmists refuse to even acknowledge, **how is someone to know the actual truth on this issue?**

p.s. I am not saying this to be provocative, or to say that I deny that there has been any global warming.  But one thing for sure is that those most upset about it seem to be making up incredibly inaccurate data (thats constantly being exaggerated, and proven wrong).

not to mention, even with so much provably incorrect data being presented by the global warming alarmists, to even question the smallest detail gets one labeled as anti-science (this seems to go against everything that science *should* be about).

Even those who freely acknowledge that there has been some global warming, but say the proposed ""solutions"" (which are even more sketchy, and show almost no scientific evidence of working, even if the global warming is as reported) seem to get savagely attacked in public forums and in the media (and by politicians).  Expressing a normally understandable disbelief in such things seems like it would be applauded by those who seek truth over an agenda.  Sadly, that is rarely the case.

Not to mention, the trillions proposed on supposed global warming ""solutions"" could perhaps be better spend on other environmental issues (like cleaning up water pollution, or removing toxic chemicals from our soil, etc).

even the way that this post, which simply expresses a slight skepticism with the current claims about global warming with most certainly be down voted, and i'll be attacked.  I don't know this empirically, but I am predicting a hostile response (hopefully I'll be proven wrong).

Still, can you be so kind as to explain why IF Global Warning is really such a problem, **why is there so much deception from those who want to ""do something"" about it?**

That's what the data is saying, not me.

""In 1990 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was predicting that if emissions rose in a “business as usual” way, which they have done, then global average temperature would rise at the rate of about 0.3 degree Celsius per decade (with an uncertainty range of 0.2 to 0.5 degree C per decade). In the 25 years since, temperature has risen at about 0.1 to 0.2 degree C per decade, depending on whether surface or satellite data is used. The IPCC, in its most recent assessment report, lowered its near-term forecast for the global mean surface temperature over the period 2016 to 2035 to just 0.3 to 0.7 degree C above the 1986–2005 level. That is a warming of 0.1 to 0.2 degree C per decade, in all scenarios, including the high-emissions ones.""

Public transport is way better than cars. 

Even a dirty diesel bus easily ends up more efficient than a car. Just because a bus takes more people.

Public transport is way easier to convert to electric, without the need for expensive and polluting batteries (using overhead wires, for example).

Public transport goes hand in hand with density. You can't have density w/o PT, you can't have (good) PT w/o density. Density means shorter trips, saved emissions. 

Look at energy usage for transportation. American cities come out so poorly compared to European cities. In America people drive on long motorways (often very slowly due to congestion) in cars. In Europe people take short trips in buses, trams and metro systems.

Even if you make all the cars electric the European model can still win using shitty diesel buses and trains. ","{""2024-12-16T10:36:21"":3}",false,

If people moved *en masse* to public transportation, emissions would be reduced overall, yes. Transport would be more efficient but would still pollute. As the technology needed to eliminate those emissions advanced, it would undoubtedly advance the electrification of cars, as well. 

Looking at it purely through a tailpipe emissions lens, it seems to me that if we succeed at eliminating transport emissions from PT, we wouldn't be far off from a place where electric cars could serve the same or similar purpose.

Your observation about overhead wires and the ease of running trolley buses is worth thinking about. Though with the falling price of those batteries and the not insubstantial cost of constructing and maintaining catenary systems, I'm not convinced this will be of practical application outside of dense urban areas where bus frequency will be very high.

I think maybe where we really diverge in our perspectives on this is in land use.

>what does antarctica gaining sea ice have to do with arctic life on the other side of the planet who are losing ice at ridiculous rates?

""Ridiculous"" is completely a relative term. It's an observation made by scientists who now have access to satellite data to observe the real-time glacial fluctuations of the poles.

I would advise you should look into the [Milankovitch Cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles). The climate is mostly controlled by the sun. In quaternary geological studies, looking at the growth of sea ice directly impacts eustatic fluctuations. All things are considered on a global scale. Yes, polar bears are regional to the northern pole, but when studying climate fluctuations, we don't ignore the big picture.

The Milankovitch Cycles indicate the planet is due for going back into a glacial cycle, which can last for several tens of thousands of years, depending on the precise control when you consider obliquity, eccentricity and precession. This rapid transition can occur within a 1,000 year period, meaning a sharp change back to lower sea levels and increased glacial presence at the poles.

The south pole shows in 2014 the largest glacial presence recorded by satellite data. So yes, we observe the melting in the north pole, but also observe growth in the south pole.

As scientists, more data is better. We can't ignore what happens in Antarctica if we are to predict what might happen in the Arctic. ","{""2024-12-16T10:19:53"":1}",false,

Upgrade to FTTP from FTTN is possible, according to the NBN website. Is the upgrade equivalent to the standard FTTP? Probably not, as evidenced by nearly two months of no replies from the NBN when I questioned them on the topic. They did confirm the Area Switch to FTTP is the same as the standard FTTP rollout.

My point was that transit is way more energy efficient anyway - to the point that even diesel transit is often preferable to electric cars (which often just run off a coal plant elsewhere). 

Thus in my opinion, 100% electric car adoption isn't that good a goal - we should be focusing on getting maybe 70% of the population using transit for nearly all trips, with electric cars for the remainder.","{""2024-12-16T10:36:24"":3}",false,

If we had managed to establish a moderate carbon price ten or twenty years ago, these technologies would already be much more scaled up, others would be on their way, and we would be half way to solving the problem already.

I presume climate related deaths are things like hypothermia, exposure etc? which is a very long-winded way of say ""fossil fuels heat our houses"". Well yes they do, but they also contribute to climate change as has been demonstrated, which is the point you're trying to cloud. We don't *need* fossil fuels for those things.

>and while millions used to die every year as a result of bad weather

Hahah what, like being blown away by a hurricane? What constitutes ""dying from bad weather"", how are you correlating this to fossil fuel use? Where are you getting your data from (apart from up your arsehole)? As I said above, electricity and technology have helped us survive, not fossil fuels in particular. You can get electricity in ways that don't pollute you know.

I'm not I am comparing it to pastured cattle. 

>and grass fed cattle is the best place holder for that niche.


Beef is a calorie dense food, yes it needs to be shipped like any other product, but it is cheaper to ship 100 calories of beef than it is to ship 100 calories of lettuce. As I mentioned I am discussing grass fed cattle, therefor no shipment for their food, or very little if hay is brought in for the winter, [though there are many innovative ways around that now](http://www.agr.gc.ca/eng/science-and-innovation/agricultural-practices/soil-and-land/soil-nutrients/sustainable-management-of-nutrients-on-the-landscape-for-in-field-livestock-winter-feeding-systems/?id=1294669298001#a6) and most hay is produced locally. If we are talking grass fed cattle (and again I am) the additional food is food that humans cannot eat and is grown on marginal lands that cannot sustainably produce annual food crops. If there was not livestock to manage this land it would be degrated as grasslands require grazing to flourish as that is how they evolved. There are certain instances of deforestation to make way for cattle production, there are also many landscapes that are destroyed in an attempt to produce annual crops. As I mentioned a properly grazed pasture is the most efficient way to capture and store carbon in most cattle producing landscapes (exception being when they attempt to convert a forest landscape to 100% forage/pasture, though [Silvopasture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvopasture) techniques are a great way to incorporate livestock production on some forested lands in a mutually beneficial way). 


As mentioned 

>There is much to be done to improve the environmental impact of livestock production 

But the solution isn't to demonize the entire industry and push for people to remove meat from their diets under the illusion that they are helping the environment. If you want to do your part, ensure your meat is coming from a sustainable source, promote and encourage producers to implement sustainable practices. The same should be done for all food procurement, there is plenty of room for improvement in the food industry outside of meat production.    ","{""2024-12-16T10:19:21"":1}",false,

>Consumers would ""attach a serious profit motive"" by flocking to buy a product that has value. Alternative energy lacks value which is why government ""attaches serious profit motive"" by regulation to force consumers to purchase what they don't want or need.

I said get the government out of the energy market.  That includes alternative energies.  You were just telling me I look through a leftist prism and yet I'm sitting here saying end alternative fuel subsidies.  I forgot how progressive and liberal that stance was.  

As far as profit motive goes - you're convinced fossil fuel subsidies end at simple monetary handouts.  It doesn't.  Our influence in the middle east is solely driven by economic interest in oil, for instance.  We need to make these companies go out and find this stuff themselves.  In spite of what you think, fossil fuels are a dwindling non-renewable resource.  Allowing pricing to be based on what the MARKET ONLY can bare, it means demand within that same market for alternatives and efficiency goes up as the cost of fossil fuels go up.  All without government doing DIDDLY SQUAT. 

 So profit motive - the company NOT hemorrhaging money on energy will do better than the company that is, and so long as neither are getting blatant fucking handouts from the government by our amazing ""conservative"" leaders, the one not saving money on energy will fail while the other succeeds.  That's just the rule of the jungle when it comes to free enterprise capitalism.

There was a cooling between the 1940s and 1970. Global temperatures from instrumental records were widely accepted to show this, and current instrumental temperature histories show this too.

But that's different from what I took you to be saying, which was that there would be cooling in the future. That was not the case, at any time.

>I was in high school in early 1970's and I remember writing an essay about climate change. As far as I remember all the media articles and popular science magazine bits you could find back then, were about cooling.

Yes, the media picked up on the cooling. There were a couple of people writing books about it, and the publicity surrounding those distorted the picture a bit, and we are learning that Exxon was already entering a misinformation campaign.

The science however was mixed but leaning warming throughout the 60s and consensus warming from mid to late 70s.

Well what's bad is that living things aren't being given enough time to adapt.  And what's even worse, living things known as human beings are going to be fighting over resources as a result.  

As far as it ""stopping"" 19 years ago - we are now averaging temperatures that were once considered a spike in an el nino event, but yeah, keep picking that 1998 starting point as if moving the starting point forward or back 2 years doesn't totally destroy that logic.

If climate change dwindles resources and people fight over those resources, why is the statement then that climate change will contribute to the growth of terrorism wrong?  If terrorism emerges  from these disputes over resources, how is that wrong?

I can see the parallel from your perspective, yes.  However, the other factors behind terrorism _beyond_ climate change dwarf whatever other factors have contributed to global warming to such a degree, to me, it's not much of a parallel at all.

Bernie Sanders obviously disagrees with you.

Far enough.  So when he says climate change will contribute to the growth of terrorism, even that you find totally hyperbolic and baseless?  The explanation he used he got from the CIA, so do you think their logic only sounds good on the surface but actually is outlandish and improbable?

>Bernie Sanders obviously disagrees with you.

Did he say climate change would be the main driver of terrorism the way we say man made CO2 is the main driver of climate change?    There is a much larger responsibility on ""other"" over climate change with regard to the driver of terrorism, than there is between man made CO2 and ""other"" in the driver of climate change.  In this comparison, climate change and man made CO2 are what's being compared as being the cause of something.  Man made CO2's role in warming dwarf's climate change's role in terrorism.   What did he say that leads you to believe he would disagree with that?


>Who said anything about volcanoes? The warming from ~1910-1940 was roughly the same in rate and magnitude as that from ~1970-2000, but few people dare attribute the early warming to mankind.

I'm just picking something that would conceivably contribute to warming.   We could go with solar activity if you'd like, which probably has had more of a role in exacerbating or limiting CO2's effect on the climate.  For instance 1910-1940 saw a rise in solar activity while 1970 was seeing a decline in solar activity.  All the meanwhile, however, temperatures continued to rise no matter what, but looking at a graph without considering solar activity, the positive and then negative effect of solar activity isn't immediately apparent.  It comes off as a rate of rise equal to later rates of rise.  Speaking of which, solar activity is way down except our temperatures continue to rise at a rate of something like .8C.  When solar activity rises again, what will that mean for us?

I think you misunderstand.  I don't care what Bernie thinks or what he means regarding climate change.  This all started with your claim that no one is saying climate change causes terrorism.  Bernie Sanders is a prominent politician who has said that very thing.  You were mistaken, which you have now acknowledged.  

>Did he say climate change would be the main driver of terrorism the way we say man made CO2 is the main driver of climate change? 

Again, I don't care.  I really can't see him saying, ""I think climate change will be a small contributing factor to future terrorism,"" if that's what you mean.  He made a clear statement that climate change is a major causal factor in terrorism.  I won't speculate on what kind of impact he really thought it might have.

>Man made CO2's role in warming dwarf's climate change's role in terrorism.

Again, if Bernie believed that, why would he bother to state the causal connection?

>We could go with solar activity if you'd like, which probably has had more of a role in exacerbating or limiting CO2's effect on the climate.

Sorry, it doesn't work like that.  Solar variation brings a host of forcings that are quite separate from CO2 forcing.

>All the meanwhile, however, temperatures continued to rise no matter what...

Not quite.  Temperatures declined from ~1940-1970, just at a time when CO2 was seeing large increases in the atmosphere.

>Speaking of which, solar activity is way down except our temperatures continue to rise at a rate of something like .8C. 

Not quite.  The present solar cycle is quite average.  Three of the last five solar cycles were exceptionally high.  Global temperatures have risen about 0.8°C over the last century, but as we have discussed, only part of that is attributable to CO2.  The rate of warming is now slower than it was during the ~1970-2000 period.

>When solar activity rises again, what will that mean for us?

The 20th century's grand solar maximum was the most active in the last 8,000 years.  Source: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2004/10/041030221144.htm

Det er helt forkert, den eneste økonomiske fordel ved diesel er skattemæssigt betinget, for at ""beskytte"" erhvervslivet. Vi burde absolut efter min mening, derimod begrænse afgiftsfritagelser for virksomheder på miljøskadelig brændsel, især diesel.

Benzin har mindre skadelig partikel udledning end diesel, jeg antog det var det mest oplagte alternativ til diesel. Det er sikkert bedre med gas, som ikke er særligt udbredt, og hvis el eller brint kan bruges er det selvfølgelig bedst.


>Samfundet og det private erhvervslivet er en symbiose


Det kan vi godt blive enige om, men det er vel ikke typisk for en symbiose at den ene part forgifter den anden. Selvfølgelig forurener vi også som private, og forurening har en omkostning, ellers er det ikke reelt forurening, og vi kan vel principielt være enige om at man ikke ligefrem skal stimulere og opfordre til forurening når det skadeligt for samfundet. Når erhverv forurener er det for at opnå noget hensigtsmæssigt som ikke kan opnås hensigtsmæssigt (herunder økonomisk) på anden vis. Hvis der er et samfundsmæssigt bedre alternativ, er den mest effektive måde at få folk til at bruge det, at lægge afgift på den uhensigtsmæssige. Det gælder for erhverv som for private, formodentlig endda mere for erhverv.


Privat forurener vi så selvfølgelig også, og endda bare for sjov undertiden, men der kommer der så et spørgsmål om livskvalitet ind, som ikke eksisterer for erhverv, erhverv eksisterer i sidste ende udelukkende på rentabiliteten af udførelsen af erhvervet.","{""2024-12-16T10:29:12"":1}",false,

Ud over det kører kraftværkerne ofte selvom vi producerer mere vindstrøm end vi kan bruge. Det skyldes 2 ting, de skal holde et ""stift net"" og at vinden er periodevis. Så det er for dyrt at lukke et kraftværk ned i 4 timer for så at starte set op igen.

Www.emd.dk/el  viser en god oversigt over vores produktion og forbrug af el. Og også el-prisen. Så kan man hurtigt se at når vinden blæseren er strømmen billig, og nogle gange en udgift at eskportere. I mine øjne er muligheden for lagring af energi den helt store elefant i rummet. Hvis vi opstiller flere vindmøller får vi langt større overproduktion i blæsevejr. I stille/normalt vejr er udnyttelsen Den samme (fordi vi kan forbruge det vindstrøm vi producerer).

Med flere vindmøller får vi derfor en ringere udnyttelse af kapaciteten da vi oftere vil få langt større overproduktioner. Naturligvis får vi mere vindmøllestrøm totalt, men de mange nye møller er 100% overflødige i blæsevejr.

Der skal skelnes mellem kapacitetsudnyttelse (af møllerne) og andel af vindstrøm. Uden lagringsmuligheder vil førstnævnte falde og sidstnævnte stige, men til en højere og højere pris (grundet udgifterne ved overproduktion).","{""2024-12-16T10:29:12"":2}",false,

Nu uden Flash, det har jeg ventet i måneder på.


Lige nu importerer vi fra Tyskland via Jylland, selvom vi har overproduktion, men vi eksporterer samtidig tilbage til Tyskalnd via Sjælland, og til Norge og Sverige.


I princippet kunne vi få f.eks. solenergi fra Polen en time tidligere ,og fra Frankrig en time senere. Og meteorologisk ligger vi så vidt jeg ved i et grænseområde for større vejr fronter, så vi kunne få vindenergi fra 2 vejrsystemer, hvis der var meget vindenergi i landende nord og syd for os.


Over større områder udglattes forsyningen fra kombination af sol og vind meget. Men selvfølgelig vil en holdbar billig energi opbevaring kunne ændre billedet totalt mht. større forsyningssikkerhed.


>Med flere vindmøller får vi derfor en ringere udnyttelse af kapaciteten


Ja det er rigtigt, medmindre der er uudnyttede geografiske områder som kan have vind når de andre ikke har, men det  er nok allerede udnyttet.


>de mange nye møller er 100% overflødige i blæsevejr.


Ikke helt hvis energien kan eksporteres, og begrænse luft forurening i lande omkring os.


>men til en højere og højere pris


Jeg er enig, bortset fra at prisen på produktion af vedvarende energi altid har været faldende, og alt andet lige, gør lavere udnyttelsesgrader rentable. Set på krone per watt uden regulerende tilskud og afgifter, er solenergi næppe rentabelt endnu, men det nærmer sig kraftigt, og samfundsmæssigt tror jeg balancepunktet er passeret.


Vidste du i øvrigt at man kan lave strøm med lysdioder der modtager lys, og med elektriske køle elementer ( peltier ) når de har forskellig temperatur på hver side.

Jeg vil mene at kødet i sig selv er CO2 neutralt, da dyrene vel næppe kan prutte mere kulstof ud end de spiser, og det kulstof de spiser fra planter må vel hovedsageligt være fra CO2 da det er det planter omsætter. Så landbrugets netto CO2 belastning kommer vel de samme steder fra som andre industrier, hovedsageligt maskiner og transport.


Jeg kan finde masser eksempler hvor hvor det diskuteres, men ingen oplysninger der sagligt begrunder at animalsk fødevare produktion skulle være et særligt CO2 problem, udover de problemer vi har generelt med produktion. Der er masser af forskellige tal om belastning i forhold til arten af opdræt og hvilke dyr der er tale om, men hvordan man når frem til de tal er væsentligt mere uklart. Hvor skulle den CO2 dyr udleder komme fra, hvis ikke fra CO2 planterne de spiser har optaget, og planterne gen dyrkes næste sæson, så udsvinget kun afviger over året, men ikke på sigt.

Ja planteædere prutter generelt mere, særligt når det er fiberholdige planter, men som jeg nævnte mener jeg at den CO2 der produceres må komme fra kulstof fra planter med minimum tilsvarende optag af CO2, og de spiste afgrøder fornys selvfølgelig.

>Selv at spise grøntsager og korn udleder.


Ja de oprindelige encellede organismer alle planter kommer fra, var så vidt vi ved, ved at begå selvmord med deres ilt produktion, og optaag af CO2 så der stort set ikke var mere tilbage. Kun fordi evolutionen resulterede i en anden encellet organisme, der kunne optage ilt og lave CO2, fordi de spiste de andre, blev den katastrofe for liv på jorden undgået. Men det er et par milliarder år siden. Den opståede økologi er baseret på ""rovdrift"" på planter for at holde den økologiske balance. Når vi så spiser dem der spiser planterne, er det nemt at forledes til at tro det i sig selv kan forrykke den balance, men da det er baseret på bæredygtighed med genbeplantning, forrykkes den egentlig ikke betydeligt, omend det miljømæssigt selvfølgelig har en konsekvens på andre måder.","{""2024-12-16T10:29:09"":1}",false,

De fleste landbrugsdyr er ikke mere skadelige end at slå sin græsplæne, eller have en kompostbunke, når du slår græs eller bruger en kompostbunke, er det bakterier der nedbryder biomassen, og det har et tilsvarende kulstof gas udslip som hvis biomassen bliver brændt, eller et dyr spiser det.


Den største forskel er at når det brændes vil der være en større del af kulilte afhængig af afbrændings metoden.


Per den logik de undersøgelser du henviser til anvender, er det sikkert også CO2 belastende når træer fælder deres blade, fordi nedbrydningen efterfølgende udleder CO2.


Eller er CO2 udledningen kun skadelig hvis bladende bliver spist af en hjort før de falder ned?


At prutte eller ånde er ikke miljøskadeligt, fordi det er en del af balancen i den globale biomasse, men forbrænding af fossilt brændstof er skadeligt, fordi det foregår i en hastighed der er for hurtig i forhold til at der ikke er en tilsvarende forøgelse i plante biomasse globalt, og i den sammenhæng er det afgjort skadeligt når man fælder skove uden genbeplantning, uanset om det er til udvidelse af by/industri områder eller veje eller landbrug. Men af de 3 er landbrug den mindst skadelige.

Måske er en traktor mere miljøskadende end en hest, men hvis traktoren bruges til at dyrke mad til alle disse dyr, så er det jo også indirekte pga. dyrelandbrug, at flere drivhusgasser bliver udledet.

 It upsets me greatly that in 2015 so many people still see climate change as up for debate, when for years and years now the scientific evidence has been overwhelming. We in the US have an entire political party in denial of well established science.  The irony is that the message of the Republican party often centers on individual responsibility and paying your own way.  Climate change is an undeniable cost of fossil fuel consumption.  We hear the Republican party complain about low income citizens taking advantage of welfare-- why don't they say anything about fossil fuel users not paying for the massive economic cost they are importing on future generations and on the millions, very possibly billions, of people that stand to be displaced or killed as sea levels rise?  

One of the central functions of even the smallest government is to recognize externalities and make sure that entities are required to cover those costs.  Right now, everyone that burns fossil fuels is taking value away from everyone else's future, and no one is being held responsible for those costs.

Not at all.  I apologize if my writing was ambiguous and suggested otherwise.  You're absolutely right that cheap energy has been a major boon to our quality of life over recent history.

I believe that putting a tax on fossil fuels to match the costs they are imparting on our environment and future absolutely makes sense.  I'm not saying we do so at such a high rate that we can't afford them at all.  Just a high enough rate that other energy sources (that won't cost us trillions of dollars in irreparable damages in the not too distant future) become more viable as alternatives.  I also think that working hard  and aggressively funding alternative energy sources makes sense.  

Economics is about balancing costs with returns to maximize value.  Right now we are not accounting for the external costs of burning fossil fuels, so our consumption is higher than is economically optimal in the long run. 

Also, the majority of westerners should certainly ""give a fuck"" about rising sea levels and other effects of catastrophic climate change.  If not out of compassion, at least out of self interest.

Det mener Jeg også at jeg medgav. Og ja fældning af regnskov er et problem. 


Men ud fra logikken i den infographic er økologisk også mere skadeligt.


Det er så heldigvis ikke altid regnskov der indvindes, men mere som da vi begyndte at bruge hede arealer, og der er stadig enorme steppe arealer som kan anvendes. Danmark er et af de lande i verden som har højst andel af landbrugs arealer og også landbrugsproduktion per indbygger. Vi er verdens største eksportør af f. eks. svinekød og smør, og vores landbrug er fuldstændigt industrialiseret. Alligevel er vurderingen af miljøministeriet at vores landbrug kun udgør 14% af vores CO2 udslip:


http://mfvm.dk/foedevarer/indsatsomraader/klima/landbrugets-udledning-af-drivhusgasser/


Danmark har historisk også drevet rovdrift på skove, men det blev erkendt at det var et problem, så man begyndte at genplante. En gang troede man at regnskov ikke kan genplantes, men selvfølgelig kan den det, og det har man nu fundet ud af hvordan man skal gøre, så kan vi jo håbe at de berørte lande iværksætter programmer for det.","{""2024-12-16T10:29:12"":1}",false,

But with something like the BP 'spill' (which itself is an interesting choice of word) or the VW emissions 'Scandal' there's many levels of agency and systemic issues which people find far more difficult to blame. 

It's far harder to calculate all of the extra deaths caused by the health impacts of NOx, and there's no single person to blame for it. 
Just imagine if a terrorist had been directly responsible for causing the deaths from 1 million tonnes of extra NOx.

[projected temperature rise (EPA)](http://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/images/science/ScenarioTempGraph.jpg)

Curves in linked plot are based on so-called [Relative Concentration Pathways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathways) which correspond to varying levels of GHG. RCP2.6 is based on the idea that emissions peak today and start to decline rapidly, and the projected increase in that scenario is just under 1 degree C. The next one up is RCP 4.5 (GHG peaks in 2040) shows a temperature increase of around 1.8C, so there's no way to limit temperature increase to below 1.5C without taking action. As far as cutting greenhouse gas emissions goes, it's plain to see that there's no political will for that. 

To humor you though, here are a few other possibilities:

* large scale ocean seeding with iron sulfide to stimulate phytoplankton blooms and draw down CO2 from the atmosphere. Like a man-made [Azolla event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azolla_event).
* pollute the atmosphere with [sulfate aerosols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfate_aerosols_%28geoengineering%29) or install reflectors at [L1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point) point to increase Earth albedo.","{""2024-12-16T10:26:55"":3}",false,

To sum up my feelings - activists think that corporations are trying to derail COP21. That is absurd. Developed countries have been trying to utilize the private sector for innovation technology and filling in a $100 billion dollar finance gap we need to close by 2020. Any representative has been asked to be there to find a solution. To say corporations shouldn't be involved is basically telling us we can't leverage some of our greatest financial and innovation assets in a multilateral decision process.

Second, fiscal austerity was accompanied by an aggressive monetary loosening that resulted in low interest rates and a depreciation of the exchange rate; alongside more flexible labor policies, these improved profits, investment, and growth. Resource booms also played a role in driving wage growth and reducing unemployment in some regions.

Let's try again.

The average citizen has a right to protest, but not if its disrupting the negotiation process, which is what protestors like Toxic Tour are doing. To say organizations are being removed from certain negotiations, people are pointing at informal negotiation processes between countries and saying that NGOs aren't being involved. That's missing the point of an informal negotiation - it's difficult to air one's grievances with another country if you have an organization with its own agenda looming over your shoulder. As hard as this can be to fathom, that can actually derail one-on-one negotiation processes between countries. That's not good for negotiation. Regarding their ability to be addressed and recognized, I disagree. The first two days of COP21 were presentations by all countries and NGOs, and they were given their respective times. They were also interviewed and reported on social media. For example, Sierra Club did quite well in its representation and twitter presence.

I think it's odd to say a corporation is ""leading and influencing"" a discussion when they don't have a negotiation say. What makes you come to that conclusion - what specifically?

I'd say they aren't. If an LDC shoots down a proposal, a corporation doesn't have a say in it, and the negotiation moves on. In the COP21, only a country can make a negotiation proposal or objection. 

Regarding the individual - average citizens are the majority of pollution in the US. Transportation emissions are majority of our GHGs. Majority of our energy is from homeowner emissions, meaning we burn to ensure energy to our homes. That's not really the point though - I think it's very typical for us to point at a spooky corporation and say ""That's the bad guy! They have no soul! They're trying to hurt our interests"" and that has a place. But not at COP21 - especially since they 1) have no direct voting representation 2) will not influence a decision because decisions have to come from majority, and LDCs and SISs don't have a corporate stake, and 3) their stake is only one small part in a multi-faceted agreement that they have no part in.

Honestly, give me a specific, legitimate example of a corporation trying to derail the negotiation process, and I'll entertain the protestors. Until then, THIS IS ALL HEARSAY. Repeat, this. is. all. hearsay.

Regarding China - they have the greatest total emissions, yes, but not per capita emissions and not historical emissions. Historically, that is still the US or the UK. From a historical standpoint, it's still the US. That is why they're still debating on historical responsibility, which is a huge conflict point in the ADP, and why China's stance is similar to Least Developing Nations.","{""2024-12-16T09:18:53"":1}",false,

Actually, RCP2.6 was chosen to have a warming of just under 2 degrees C **above preindustrial levels** ([see figure SPM.10](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf)), which matches the meaningless pledge in Copenhagen and reaffirmed in Paris. We already have 1C of warming as of 2010, which your chart doesn't show. RCP4.5 would give a temperature increase of 2.5C by 2100, not 1.8C as you read off your chart.

And the IPCC fixed its climate models in 2011. [Research since then](http://ameg.me/) indicates the IPCC were too optimistic.

Never mind the article I posted, what about UN estimates?

> Deputy High Commissioner for Refugees L. Craig Johnstone said Monday at the two-week UN Climate Change Conference in Poznan that even by the most conservative predictions up to 250 million people will be displaced by the middle of this century as a result of extreme weather conditions, dwindling water reserves and a degradation of agricultural land. Many people will also be forced to flee their homes to escape fighting over meagre resources.

> Johnstone, speaking in a UNHCR-organized panel discussion, said that in real terms this meant that the number of displaced would rise by a minimum of **six million** each year due to climate change.

Six million \* 85 years = 510 million by 2100. Not ""100-250 million over the next 100 years"".

So we need to close the coal plants too, how does that affect the tar sands?

They are both extremely big issues - either of them, if not dealt with and severely curtailed, will blow the carbon emissions budget. Of course, I can say the same for many sectors, such as aviation and beef.

The analysis also completely excludes the emissions involved in extracting and refining the oils:

> Additional emissions resulting from natural gas, diesel and electricity use during bitumen extraction, upgrading and refining have not been included here, but could increase these numbers [original commentary doi:10.1038/nclimate1421]

Nor did they include the effects of oil sand caused LULUCF (ie deforestation). In fact, they estimated effects as adding another 17%:

> However, such a life-cycle comparison is not included in Weaver and Swart’s analysis, owing to the complexity of assessing future technological changes for this and other fuels. But their calculations suggest that a full life-cycle analysis increases the overall emissions from oil sands by roughly 17%. [source](http://www.nature.com/news/canadian-oil-sands-defusing-the-carbon-bomb-1.10110)

There is no point multiplying the emissions by the size of the oil, coal or gas reserves worldwide as Weaver does. Our only question should be how to generate electricity and energy the most efficiently in terms of emissions, during the transition period to renewable energy sources. The oil sands fail hugely on this aspect.

The only advantage they have is economic to the nation that holds them, which of course, is what every nation is thinking when it exploits its own fossil fuel reserves, thus blowing the carbon budget and locking in devastating climate change.

> Burning all the oil in the world would only raise temperatures by less than one degree, the paper concludes.

How mildly stated. We already have 1C of warming, and world governments hope to limit further rises to less than one degree, although island nations warn that more than half a degree will devastate them.

No they are not.

Not all land is equally productive in regards to solar or wind. Fossil fuel plants can be built anywhere and have basically the same productivity. Nuclear plants less so, but are still less limited by geography or weather.

>Remove all fossil fuel subsidies and enact a carbon tax, and there you go.

Renewables are subsidized more per MWh than fossil fuels by a factor of 3 last I checked. By an even bigger ratio than nuclear.

Further, most fossil fuel subsidization is on the consumption side, not production; fossil fuels aren't just used for energy but also medicine, textiles, plastics, and industrial lubricants; many ""subsidies"" are general business deductions than any business can take such as the actual cost of running the business and it's just that the fossil fuel industry is a big sector so the aggregated amount is larger than many others.

And no, renewables are not infant technology. All of them have existed for over a century. Wind turbines were first used to produce electricity in 1887. The first solar cells used selenium in 1876, and photovoltaic cells using silicon in 1954. Hydroelectric power was first used in 1882. Geothermal in 1892.

>Everything is going to have to be electric eventually. Electric cars, trucks, trains, planes, ships. Fortunately when you do this the gross energy demand curve for the whole growing population gets cut by 1/3 by 2050.

So when a ship's battery dies in the middle of the ocean which is easier? Changing out hundreds of cells, spending several hours charging it, or just pumping more fuel in couple hours or less than an hour? Keep in mind that a fossil fuel powered ship can refuel while running, whereas it's more technically difficult to do with an electric one.

When it comes to time sensitive cargo like food or medicine, are you really going to prioritize environmental idealism over whether a human being starves/gets medical care?

Electric planes would be much less reliable or efficient in transporting cargo. Seriously, using a battery to run an engine isn't going to be enough for cargo or mass passenger transport at any reasonable speed.

>Also, consider the end-goal, which is no centralized energy stations.

Oh so not taking advantage of economies of scale and making energy more expensive. 

Personally I care more about the poor who will be hurt most by this plan. 

>We should invest in soft geoengineering such as Carbon Capture and Storage and tree planting. We should invest in nuclear fusion research. And we should invest more in NASA.

You know if we used nuclear power instead we would have a lot more money available to invest in those things.

>Really, check out that website. 

It's like any other website like it I've read: environmental cherry picking and ignoring the economics of the situation, which reflects in your arguments. You just keep saying ""we need to be investing in all these cool things that sound cool and nice"" and not consider that every investment is about tradeoffs. There's no cost/benefit analysis here; just ""throw a bunch of someone else's money at things that sound cool to me"".

If you think that they are influencing countries- I encourage you to look up the agenda of the conference. No one is negotiating for a particular type of energy. That isn't even in the negotiating text. Countries have their own ""nationally determined contributions"" where they detail what their own national energy plans are. You should look there for that information.

Subjectively, regarding nuclear power, I want to propose this line of thinking for you: every type of energy creates waste. Even solar; to manufacture a solar panel requires manufacturing, usually in a carbon powered plant. Corporations aren't polluting for pollution's sake. A lot of these energy companies are generating to meet OUR energy demands. So it's partially our fault. 

Nuclear power has come a long way since the 60s and 70s, the waste is now minimal and does have a contingency for storage and maintenance, and more importantly, it generates ZERO carbon emissions, meaning it's good for climate change. It's also still incredibly expensive. Subjectively, ask this question: why would an energy corporation, which has invested multimillions in a specific industry (coal, oil, etc.) want to advocate for a technology that is more expensive? It makes no sense. It hurts their revenue and their bottom line. 

And to further debate: this is STILL just hearsay. In addition to the fact that it makes no sense, based on the reason I just gave you, I haven't seen one article verifying the claim for corporations wanting nuclear. As for my claims saying that corporations aren't influencing negotiations for nuclear - look up a country, any country in the negotiation, and find their ""reported INDC"". You can probably just Google it. To see the text they're debating on, look up ""ADP negotiations draft text"". They'll both comprehensively outline exactly what has been done for climate change, what will be done, and what is to be negotiated on in Paris.

Having read the entire 85 page paper, I can tell you this: they're negotiating on target climate level, classifications for country, loss and damage, and international finance. The private sector is only mentioned in international finance.

This is exactly **why** they could come to an agreement and couldn't come to an agreement previous times. 

Actually this is the strength of the agreement in itself. Also the ratification process would imply this (matter of time). Hence additional reports had to be made such as the DDPP to explicitly show individual countries an transformation to decarbonization can go on par with economic growth. Which again, is not in the agreement, because if done so, there wouldn't definitely not be an agreement. You cant force measures. Countries have to willingly cooperate based on scientific arguments that implicate measures and more importantly, economic growth.

I very much agree with Tao on this. The ideal outcome, from the economist's perspective, would of course be to have a global, harmonized carbon price across the entire global economy (or at least an overwhelming majority of it). However, the question of how to achieve this is tricky, and this is where politics intervenes. Few (if any) national governments would be comfortable surrendering taxation authority to a global body such as the UNFCCC (as even the smaller example of the EU's inability to achieve fiscal union demonstrates). Accordingly, carbon pricing will have to originate at the national level, in a bottom-up approach. This presents challenges in terms of comparability of effort, as some states will choose (or already have chosen) a carbon tax, while others will choose an implied price via a cap-and-trade system, and yet others may choose non-price climate policy mechanisms such as standards, etc. If a country wished to ensure that foreign imports (from a country with a non-existent or lesser carbon price) face the same carbon price applied domestically, it may wish to erect a border carbon adjustment (a tariff at the border that equalizes the carbon price facing the import with that faced by domestic producers). Comparing the prices, implied prices, and non-price mechanisms applied to greenhouse gases is a major challenge, but will become unavoidable if such ""border carbon adjustments"" proliferate and trade disputes are initiated.

As a result of these challenges, I believe that coordination between jurisdictions from the very first steps of even designing climate policy is essential. International organizations such as the OECD and World Bank, as well as think thanks such as Carnegie, have done much research and writing on different optimal policy designs and the way these policies interact with one another. By paying attention early on to the way that different policy mechanisms and carbon prices interface, we can avoid headaches and disputes down the road.

Finally, we should draw attention to the fact that carbon pricing is already starting to quietly spread, with 40 national-level carbon pricing instruments (both cap-and-trade and taxes) and 23 subnational-level instruments currently in existence [data according to World Bank]. These instruments vary greatly in terms of carbon price, the sectors and emissions covered, the strength of compliance mechanisms, and other design features. This underscores both the opportunities and challenges inherent in the spread of bottom-up carbon pricing instruments globally.","{""2024-12-16T09:56:39"":7}",true,

For my part I think that COP21 built new alliances that made it possible for all world nations--despite their differences-- to come together and create a roadmap. Emissions were established country-by-country (individual national emissions reductions aren't legally binding). So it will be up to countries to implement new rules, and we'll have to wait and see how actual implementation progresses. There were glaring omissions in the agreement, including in the oil sector: shipping and aviation emissions received no mention whatsoever. The greatest need coming out in my view is renewed attention to information tracking. The oil sector is a particular problem. Beyond bunker fuels in shipping and aviation, I think that the oil sector inventory (which dates back to IPCC emission factors from 2006) may significantly undercount GHGs from oil extraction, refining, transport, and end use throughout the sector.

But what about in terms of policy? Even if the Paris agreement was fully legally binding in every respect, how much 'teeth' does international environmental law have in the first place?

(1) The fact that the 1.5 degree target was in play, and in fact eventually became enshrined in the agreement, was likely the biggest surprise. This is due in no small part to the work of Climate Analytics and its partners in supporting the scientific capacity and strategy behind the delegations of numerous small island states. It eventually became the centerpiece of the ""high ambition coalition"" (the US, EU, Japan, and a number of small island states and least developed countries) that was formed in secret in mid-2015 and unveiled itself with only a few days before the end of COP21. 

(2) Related to the above point, the 1.5 degree target will endure even more scrutiny and debate than the 2 degree target in terms of its achievability. We are currently on track - with today's policies - to overshoot this new, more ambitious target by approximately 2 degrees. 

(3) If the world is to achieve the 1.5 degree target, negative emissions technologies will almost certainly be necessary. These have yet to be proved at scale with full commercial viability, and the term itself is not entirely specific and clear in terms of what technologies are implied. This will remain a controversial feature of the agreement.

(4) The 1.5 degree target is not the ""only game in town"". If one looks at Article 4 of the agreement, it reads that ""Parties aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century"". What does this mean?  It is non-binding, but it clearly signals that countries endeavor to be  *net GHG neutral* by 2050. That is far better than even the G7 announcement earlier this year, which aims for net decarbonization by the end of the century. It also explicitly applies to *all* GHGs, not just carbon.

In the end, the U.S. achieved this aim (though there was some significant drama at the end when a certain provision on developed world mitigation commitments included the word ""shall"" instead of ""should"" - which implied a legally binding status.

I'm interested to see if the agreement will play a role in any court's decision on the legal status of CPP. Even if CPP is held up in court, the US government now has a clear mandate to put in place policies to achieve progress towards what it agreed to in Paris.","{""2024-12-16T09:56:42"":8}",false,

French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius (the widely-lauded President of COP21 who chaired the sessions and deftly combined an open, transparent approach at the outset with a muscular, clever back-doors diplomacy in the final hours)

Miguel Arias-Canete (the EU Energy & Climate Commissioner and EU lead representative spent much of the past year on a plane jetting around to various national capitals for various meetings - both public and private - meant to lay the groundwork for a constructive agreement among key powers at Paris). He reportedly slept only 11 hours in the final week of COP21, but this not unique and his team undoubtedly deserves tremendous praise for empowering him to play such a central role in climate diplomacy this year.

There are always various discussions about how to legally binding the agreement and then what penalty for non-compliance. Unfortunately that is also one of the key issues got Copenhagen failed in 2009, because countries could not get agreed on a legally binding emission targets and the potential penalties. 

The Paris agreement consists of a legally binding core agreement, but no target for each country, and non-binding INDCs. INDC is what country committed to do voluntarily, so there is no binding element there anyway. This is a smart way to increase participation so we get the agreement at the end, but risks of low ambition. That is why there is 5 year stocktaking process in the agreement for parties to ratchet up efforts in future. However, no binding still. 
There was a treaty that had stringent penalty terms for non-compliance so in theory nations could face penalties like on trade and other aspects. That is Kyoto Protocol, but at the end, countries like Canada and Japan just quit the 2nd phase and avoided the penalty. 
So yes I am afraid penalty does not work quite well on the climate change agreement, at least for now.

I like your framing of ""regenerative capitalism"" very much - it captures quite poignantly the challenge facing capital markets in an age when we are rapidly depleting our planet's natural capital. 

As a quick aside, conventional thinking has tended to measure economic robustness in terms of flows (GDP growth) rather than stocks (acquired wealth). This is true for financial capital, but also very true of natural capital (with ""stocks"" being the wealth of ecosystem services, atmospheric carbon storage, etc.). A more rigorous, nuanced, and sustainable financial system would account for stocks as well as flows, for natural capital as well as financial capital.

If you are looking to identify the spoilers, clearly there will always be entrenched interests that extract rents from their position of power. In this particular case, it includes those that extract rents from turning (unvalued) natural capital into (valued) financial capital. 

The real question is whether our understanding and quantification of the role that a broad swath of ecosystem services play (not just CO2 and CO2 storage space) outpaces their depletion and degradation. 

It marks, in my opinion, one of the next great frontiers for enlightened economics (along with a better understanding of economics of artificial intelligence, inequality, evolving labor markets, etc.)","{""2024-12-16T09:56:43"":3}",false,

I’d like to zoom in on how the commitments will be monitored. If I understand correctly, the legally-binding core agreement mandates that each country monitor and report its progress, but the level of reductions will be based on the non-binding INDCs. In other words, all parties are legally required to enter a monitoring process, but whatever they do in terms of emissions is up to them, is that correct? 

If so, can you expand more on how the legally-binding processes will work? My impression is that there are two main processes: the first in which countries will reconvene every five years starting 2020 to update their plans, and the second in which countries will reconvene every five years starting 2023 to report on their progress. Are there any other processes? And will they be handled by the UNFCCC during future conferences, or have the specifics of how they would work not been drawn yet?

Additionally, I would definitely appreciate any insight on the position of Indonesia during the summit and going forward.

The Obama administration and Ernest Moniz have expressed the need for an ""all-of-the-above"" energy policy. However, the current budget (at least from my perspective) offers very little incentive to the exploration of other technologies (outside of solar, wind, and storage) that would help ease the transition to a higher renewable portfolio. Keeping the COP21 in mind, there needs to be someone who explores the worst case scenario if the majority of the grid is dependent on renewable's (nothing against them) and energy storage systems that are technology intensive. This is where cyber-security comes into play. As smart grid is implemented and as more and more devices are connected to the internet, cyber-security becomes crucial to grid reliability.In a scenario where renewables are targeted, we would want the generators filling their role to be as clean as possible.

I would say two things:

**(1)** Some of the negotiating dynamics witnessed at Paris (and previous COPs) are due not exclusively to the divergent positions of the respective parties, but due also to the divergent *capacities* of various parties' negotiating teams. For example, many small islands and least-developed countries don't have the scientific and financial resources to match the large teams working around the clock for parties such as US and EU. Not only are small island state negotiation teams under-equipped, but there are simply not enough negotiators to attend all of the parallel sessions that occur at the outset of the COP. 

As a result, the most strategic course of action for these teams is often to block or say ""no"" to proposals that emerge from side negotiating sessions, at least until they have the time to digest and understand what is being negotiated and what the full implications are. This is an understandable and rational response, but as a result such states are often depicted as holding ""hardline"" positions or ""blocking progress"" in media stories, particularly those in the developed world. It is a symptom of broader power and resource asymmetries in the international system, rather than a feature of the climate negotiations themselves, *per se*.


**(2)** The extensive civil society presence at COP21 can be seen as a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it introduces important and often-neglected voices to the summit that otherwise may not be fully represented by national-level officials (this includes indigenous peoples, special interest groups, etc.). Civil society groups oftentimes also have semi-official functions, such as providing advisory or analytical services to island states and poor countries as mentioned in the paragraph above. 

On the other hand, the proliferation of civil society groups can be seen as increasing the ""transaction costs"" of the negotiations, by increasing the political pressure on negotiators and (arguably) making them less willing to openly and frankly discuss issues for fear of leaks and losing control of the narrative during the negotiations. One colleague at a similar institution to my own voiced an opinion to me on the sidelines of COP21 that the civil society presence is, on a net basis, counterproductive. 

I personally disagree with this, but it's an interesting view. Negotiators have complained in private about the significant costs in terms of time and focus incurred by the need to regularly brief civil society on the negotiations, even when they aren't going to disclose sensitive details. To my mind, civil society (along with business, local government officials, and key global technocratic figures such as Mark Carney at the Bank of England) played a fundamentally critical role in mobilizing the political pressure that led to an agreement. The political and ""soft power"" costs for any single country to block the deal were simply too high, and this is largely to the credit of mature, knowledgeable outside groups that shaped the narrative leading up to the summit.

There were a number of amusing approaches used by Fabius and his team, including deliberately *not* releasing new drafts to the negotiators on either empty stomachs or late in the night with fatigue setting in (these things may seem trivial, but after two weeks of intensive work and long nights, the human component of negotiations becomes magnified). 

For example, after having released a draft thursday night that kept negotiators up for much of the night, the French surprised many by not releasing the next version of the draft on Friday, and keeping it until Saturday morning. Then, they held off on the release of the draft until after lunch on Saturday, making sure everyone was rested (and satiated). 

Fabius and the French (along with the EU team and others) also did a good job of avoiding a hold-up from a number of large African states (Nigeria, South Africa, and others) who wanted special reference to the vulnerabilities and special role played by the African continent. This would have been awkward and complicated: what of small island states, or vulnerable states in Southeast Asia and Latin America? The French went around these large states, directly to the smaller, most vulnerable African countries to address their desires. Satisfied, some of the smaller African states saw little benefit from spending political capital to back Nigeria and the other large states, and the possible collision was avoided. 

On a more lighthearted note, Fabius said at the end of the conference ""it takes only a small gavel to accomplish great things."" How right he was - Fabius strategically had a quick gavel whenever he needed to push through a new change to the text that had achieved the OK from key players, barely even looking up to see if other countries wanted to object and draw out the deliberations. 

From masterful backroom shuttle diplomacy to a truly balanced outreach to developed and developing countries alike, to control over the pacing of events that kept everyone on their toes, Fabius deserves the laudatory calls of *chapeau!* that were foisted upon him at the summit's conclusion.","{""2024-12-16T09:56:55"":46}",false,

That's right - Germany has had some major challenges in building high-voltage power lines from Northern Germany (where they have built out plentiful wind capacity) to parts of South Germany where the lion's share of industrial and automotive hubs (and thus large power demand) are located. Due to ""NIMBYism"" (Not In My BackYard), the much-needed power lines have been repeatedly delayed and stymied.

As a result, there have been increasing ""loop flows"" (the transfer of power from Region A in Country 1 to Region B in Country 1 by passing through Country 2) that see power generated in Northern Germany travel through the grids of Poland and Czech Republic before ending up in Southern Germany. This would not be an issue if the grids in Poland and the Czech Republic were more modernized and reinforced, or if the power coming from Northern Germany was more smooth or predictable (unlike solar, another variable renewable energy source, wind is a bit more tricky to predict). 

The European network of transmission system operators (""ENTSO-E"") recently came out with a report that showed that one of Europe's major grid vulnerabilities ahead of the coming winter is in Poland. Poland is one of the most isolated energy markets in Europe, with the ability to import just 2% of imported electricity. In effect, the loop flows take up capacity on the Polish grid and restrict Poland's ability to import power from neighbors at certain times. ENTSO-E is working on remedying the issue via better coordination between system operators, grid reinforcements, and other measures.","{""2024-12-16T09:56:56"":6}",true,

The difference in emissions would likely not justify the addition cost for the oil. At current prices (oil at roughly $40/barrel and coal at between $10 and $45/short ton), oil is roughly 3.5 to 10 times more valuable on an energy unit basis.

Regarding how the commitments will be monitored, your understanding is completely correct, and I know of no substantive details that have been agreed to beyond what you laid out here. Here is the relevant text:

- ""In communicating their nationally determined contributions, all Parties shall provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement...Each Party shall communicate a nationally determined contribution every five years in accordance with decision 1/CP.21 and any relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Paris Agreement and be informed by the outcomes of the global stocktake referred to in Article 14.""

Clearly, more detail has yet to be worked out at future meetings on how these various monitoring, reporting, and verification procedures will work.

Thanks also for mentioning the fires in Indonesia. They were relatively poorly-publicized and didn't receive the attention they deserved, even though they were consequential enough to cut short President Jokowi's visit to Washington, DC to see President Obama. The tropical peatland and forest fires ablaze throughout Indonesia resulted emission of nearly a gigaton of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in only the first several weeks - more than the *entire annual emissions of Germany*. Since then, emissions from the fire have risen to more than an estimated 1.7 gigatons of GHGs, surpassing the annual emissions of Japan as well. On at least 38 days, the daily emissions from the fire exceeded the daily emissions of the entire U.S. economy. This was truly a full-scale environmental disaster that much of the world didn't notice, made worse by an El-Nino year that has led to dry conditions throughout much of the Indonesian forest. It's the worst such fire in Indonesia since 1997. Even ASEAN (the Association of South-East Asian Nations) has unsuccessfully attempted to prevent the crisis through an agreement on trans-boundary haze which calls for strong national and international efforts.

At Paris, Indonesia indeed played a fairly low-key role. It increased slightly its pledge made at Copenhagen in 2009 to cut emissions by 26% by 2030, up to 29%. The Indonesian negotiators were consistently critical of developed countries, and tried to get a review mechanism that would apply more stringently to developed countries. They were not, however, publicly aligned with Saudi Arabia and others that opposed some of the more ambitious provisions in the climate agreement. In the end, they were focused intently on a number of specific issues high on Indonesia's agenda (especially forests) and left the heavy lifting to other players.

In other words, future oil-climate strategies will need to be more nuanced than ""produce it all"" or ""leave it in the ground."" With oil supplies expected to dominate the energy sector--at least through mid century--all oil producers will be engaged (willingly or not) in some way. In fact, oils will increasingly compete against other oils and climate change will increasingly be factored into that competition. The Oil-Climate Index developed by Carnegie, U Calgary, and Stanford is working to bracket the GHG emissions of different oils in each country. It's likely that many countries have both higher- and lower-emitting oils. But there is no current market signal to produce lower GHG-emitting oils or to innovate to reduce a country's/company's oil emissions. It will take different approaches in different places. In terms of the Saudis solutions lie in: generating steam with concentrated solar (e.g., GlassPoint) and developing low-carbon pathways for hydrogen addition for their heavier oils. For Russia, the most effective way to cut their emissions is to reduce flaring, venting and fugitive emissions of associated gas. New satellites can monitor and induce emissions reductions. These are a few near-term oil-climate solutions that merit inclusion in these countries' COP22 INDCs. If policymakers approach this correctly, the ""aid"" given to the oil industry will likely come in the form of economic transfers from those oil suppliers with higher GHG emission footprints to other oil suppliers with lower GHG emissions.","{""2024-12-16T09:56:47"":5}",false,

Une délicate attention qui n’est pas appréciée à sa juste valeur : ""Pourquoi m’avez-vous fait quelque chose que je connais déjà, lui lance le ministre ? Si je viens à l’étranger, ce n’est pas pour manger ce que j’ai chez moi !""","{""2024-12-16T10:27:13"":15}",true,

On oublie souvent que son cuisinier n'était autre que [Marie-Antoine Carême](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Antoine_Car%C3%AAme), le premier ""chef"", le roi des cuisiniers, l'inventeur de la haute cuisine. Les plus grands succès de Talleyrand, et notamment son actuation magistrale au Congrès de Vienne ont été en grande partie dus au talent de Carême. 

EDIT: Ceci dit, la mauvaise cuisine a parfois aussi eu des effets positifs en diplomatie. J'ai lu, par exemple, que lors des premiers préparatifs des accords d'Oslo entre Israéliens et Palestiniens, les deux délégations ont été reçues par Bill Clinton à Camp David, et que tout était bloqué jusqu'à ce que les deux délégations commencent à se plaindre d'unisson du mauvais houmous servi par les Ricains.

No this isn't a perfect solution - i admit that. But testing this out. Seeing if it scales - what's the harm? What bad could it possibly do? 

They're investing TRILLIONS a year in fossil fuel subsidy. A fraction of that would run this for the 10 years they say it would take for them to reduce co2 to pre-industrial levels. Watch the video.

Like you said, its suggestion so symbolic in nature and on the honor system. So most of the time no one does anything or changes. That is though, if the people fight it, especially at the local levels. If people don't get involved at local levels, then many towns will go right along with this agenda 21 sustainable developments plan.

It seems to me the the TPP is the real beast because it actually has enforcement mechanisms in it, which could start to establish world courts which could enforce it. That seems to be the problem with COP21 is that there is no way to enforce it. If the TPP is passed it could be the first blow to setting up a world court, which then could lead to climate change legislation being passed. I will try to re read more of what your said.

As the late economist [Milton Friedman put it](http://medillreports.com/2014/10/22/what-would-free-market-economist-milton-friedman-do-about-climate-change/), ""There’s always a case for the government to get involved when what two people do affects a third party...The best way to go about it is to impose a tax on the amount of pollutants emitted by a car and make it in the self-interest of the manufacturers and consumers to keep down the amount of pollution in that way.""

The reality is, the externalities we're *already paying* are incredibly opaque. One of the advantages of a carbon tax, as the experts will tell you, is that it *is* transparent. 

> The issue with Fee & Dividend is that while its economically idealistic, its politically non-feasible because its a wealth transfer scheme by another name. 

I don't see how it's politically non-feasible when [a majority of the U.S. public supports it](https://e360.yale.edu/digest/majority_in_us_support_revenue-neutral_carbon_tax_survey_says/3222/), and [a version has been successively tried in British Columbia, where it remains popular](http://www.economist.com/blogs/americasview/2013/08/climate-policy-canada). 

> Its more likely to impact rural, high-carbon-footprint conservatives and benefit urban, low-carbon-footprint liberals.

Please provide evidence to support this claim. The [evidence I've seen](http://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/who_pollutes_greenhouse_gas_footprint_0.pdf) shows that wealth is the largest predictor of who will be most impacted by CF&D, not because there's anything inherently wrong with being wealthy, but because it just so happens that the wealthy tend to pollute more. The wealthy don't have to stop being wealthy to choose not to pollute less.

When your hypothesis is subjected to study, the authors find [""...there is little systematic variation in carbon tax burdens across regions of the country.](https://www.aeaweb.org/assa/2009/retrieve.php?pdfid=346)

As Jacob Goldin's research suggests, consumers are better able to avoid taxes when they're included in the sticker price, rather than when they remain separate. 

> If you tax it at the pump, and put on the receipt that the person paid X for the gas, Y for regular gas taxes, and Z for the carbon tax, then it is transparent.

Again, as Jacob Goldin's research suggests, a lot of people don't bother to look at their receipt to see how much they've paid in tax, which means it's not actually more transparent in practice.

That's in fact what it does. Doesn't that make that framing more transparent?

According to the [IPCC AR5 WGIII SPM](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_summary-for-policymakers.pdf) (p. 28), 

> Since AR4, cap and trade systems for GHGs have been established in a number of countries and regions. Their short-run environmental effect has been limited as a result of loose caps or caps that have not proved to be constraining (limited evidence, medium agreement). 

In contrast, 

> In some countries, tax-based policies specifically aimed at reducing GHG emissions—alongside technology and other policies—have helped to weaken the link between GHG emissions and GDP (high confidence).

So, cap-and-trade has not been so effective, while carbon taxes have. I would invite you to actually read [Ch. 15 of the report](http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg3/ipcc_wg3_ar5_chapter15.pdf) and see the evidence for yourself.

When you say ""avoid"", is that a bad thing in that they cheat the system, or its a good thing that they lower their consumption?

Claiming people ""don't look"" at the receipt isn't a valid reason not to have it.  Many people *will* want to look at the receipt and know the true cost.  They should at least have the opportunity.

It's a good thing in that it lowers their consumption. An upstream tax is hard to cheat because there are relatively few primary sources. 

> Claiming people ""don't look"" at the receipt isn't a valid reason not to have it. Many people will want to look at the receipt and know the true cost. They should at least have the opportunity.

They already have the true cost, because once the tax is in place, it's included in the price. That's the beauty of internalizing an externality.

The only really ""hard number"" such a survey could precisely supply is the price of the tax. The others would need to be estimates. However, [those do exist if you really want them](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2014/jun/13/how-revenue-neutral-carbon-tax-creates-jobs-grows-economy). The example in British Columbia suggests those estimates are reasonable. 

> Regarding your information on carbon taxes vs trade, I agree trade has been non-impactful, but I think your statement about carbon taxes isn't valid due to the disclaimer of it relying on being alongside technology and other policies.

You can't remove technology from the equation in the modern age, not in real-world observations. 

> Regarding a use for the revenue? Yes, I'd like to see it go strictly to R&D, but absolutely not via subsidizing renewable industries companies.

Do you mean basic science research then? I could actually get behind that, although in the short term consumers would hurt. Basic science funding pays huge dividends, but long pay-out times.

Green campaigners were given promises about the revenue going to environmental causes, and then the politicians stole the whole thing for general fund spending on whatever project they wanted.

It doesn't, because you don't believe in devastating climate change in the first place. If you don't believe there is a problem, you cannot have an opinion as to whether a solution to that problem is effective or not.

In reality, your only goal is to promote climate inaction, very likely because you profit in some way from the commerce of fossil fuels.

**Abstract**

In December 2015 in Paris, leaders committed to achieve global, net decarbonization of human activities before 2100. This achievement would halt and even reverse anthropogenic climate change through the net removal of carbon from the atmosphere. However, the Paris documents contain few specific prescriptions for emissions mitigation, leaving various countries to pursue their own agendas. In this analysis, we project energy and land-use emissions mitigation pathways through 2100, subject to best-available parameterization of carbon-climate feedbacks and interdependencies. We find that, barring unforeseen and transformative technological advancement, anthropogenic emissions need to peak within the next 10 years, to maintain realistic pathways to meeting the COP21 emissions and warming targets. Fossil fuel consumption will probably need to be reduced below a quarter of primary energy supply by 2100 and the allowable consumption rate drops even further if negative emissions technologies remain technologically or economically unfeasible at the global scale.","{""2024-12-16T10:38:27"":1}",false,

The DNC needs to dedicate a team to writing executive orders that will reverse 100% of what Donald Trump does.

Even have the circuits review them in advance if possible to make sure they pass scrutiny.

Whoever their candidate is will then be given all of the executive orders and, once that person wins the presidency, all of the executive orders can be signed on day 1.

This would be a winning strategy, as there would be no confusion as to exactly what the next Democrat is going to do on day 1 and it will be easier to convince third party and independent voters like myself to hold my nose and vote Democratic in 2020.

Not really how it works. It wasn't a mistake that Republicans didn't have a plan ready. Republicans don't put out plans because they don't have any. What they do is wait for Democrats to put out plans and then make ridiculous attacks on them to muddy the waters. Think 'Death panels' and 'government takeover of healthcare'. It's not a matter of having the plans ready to go on day one. It's a matter of withstanding a Republican propaganda machine that is incredibly effective at convincing their zombie voters of whatever they want them to believe.

2010 disproves that though. We not only put out a plan, but actually passed it into law. That plan made the most significant improvements to healthcare in 40 years. That's in addition to saving the economy, investing billions in green energy, adding regulations to Wall Street, providing healthcare to 9/11 first responders, ending DADT, increasing money for pell grants, signing the START treaty with Russia to destroy nukes, and probably a bunch of other stuff I'm forgetting.

So in that long comment talking in generalities about how much of a ""bad person"" Hillary is, your one and only example was a misinterpretation of a thing someone else said and you apparently read in breitbart or some source which took and repeated their nonsense.

Any attempt to make any sort of equivalency between the two candidates is absolutely laughable.  One is utter fucking garbage, the other is less-than-ideal - in a world where *literally every candidate everywhere ever* will be ""less than ideal"" in some way or another.  In terms of scandal, any criticism which is partially valid for Hillary is valid ten-fold for drumpf, and of course he has many more of his own as well.  So that's why you're being downvoted.  I understand that you believe Hillary was better than drumpf, as does anyone who is able to complete a sentence, but anything close to an equivalency is not valid and that's why people are reacting as such.","{""2024-12-16T10:22:17"":12}",true,

So?

>Taking foreign government donations for her campaign. (https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/11915)

This seems to be an email thread from a bunch of random campaign people about whether or not to take donations.  Do you have some reporting that shows donations were taken, from whom, for the campaign rather than the foundation, and importantly, that this wasn't done in greater and shadier measure by the opponent?  And that any of it was illegal?  The state of campaign finance is pretty dismal and needs to be changed, but the reality of the situation is that it exists in its current form and to deny that is to deny things that are necessary for elections in the current reality.

>Rigging the primaries. I hope you don't try and debate this one. Obviously, she cannot solely be blamed for this. But she was on the team.

Of course I will.  But you should try to debate it first, because I see no evidence that this happened, that it was orchestrated by the candidate, and that it was improper to begin with, so you haven't actually made an argument here.  Remember that the party is a private organization and can absolutely decide that they would prefer one candidate to another.  The primary process essentially exists so that the party can decide which candidate is more popular, they could throw out the whole primary system completely if they wanted to, but of course they don't because they also want to appear democratic (strange that our country as a whole doesn't have any problem with throwing out the votes and ignoring democracy entirely though for 2 of the last 3 ""presidents"").  They may have been wrong (though, turns out she won, so they picked well even if they could have picked better).  And turning a non-issue into an issue did harm the eventual general election campaign, which is why I always treated it as the non-issue that it was from the beginning.

Besides, its clear that the difference was name recognition.  Hillary won lower-information voters, Bernie won higher-information ones.  This is to be expected.  The same way that drumpf got a lot of votes from low-information voters in the general election, because the media wouldn't stop talking about him for 18 months and never bothered to talk about anyone else including his direct opponent.

You fundamentally undermine democracy if you believe that they're private, therefore can prefer one candidate over another. The DNC's own charter literally states that they should 'exercise impartiality': https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2989759-Impartiality-Clause-DNC-Charter-Bylaws-Art-5-Sec-4.html. Please see the DNC fraud lawsuit in Florida, in regards to clear rigging of the primaries.

Sure, there were other forces at play that held Bernie back. But it was not a level playing field to begin with.

Coal jobs are not coming back, but I understand why those areas would want them to. [There are *many* more jobs in solar and wind than coal](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/25/climate/todays-energy-jobs-are-in-solar-not-coal.html).

* Agree there is a decent push for nationalism.

* I don't think many people support *religious* bans or the wall really. But yeah a lot of people are for tighter immigration in one form or another, although a lot aren't. Personally I'd be fine if we modeled our immigration after Canada or the UK, it's hard to move there unless you have a skill the citizens don't already offer (or you have family there). [This](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1660/immigration.aspx) has an equal amount of people thinking our immigration is fine as is as it does people who want to decrease it.

When looking for stats on how many people don't believe in climate change, the numbers vary based on the poll. But it is always a small % that don't believe it exists at all. A slightly larger percent believes it exists but human interaction doesn't affect it. Most believe in global warming and want to take action against it. 

* There is some concern about muslims, this is worldwide at this point. I like to imagine most of those people who are ridiculous about it are trolls. This could continue to grow though

* Agreed that socialism is a bad word in this country. But there are a lot of people in this country who support those ideals, just not the majority.

>I was basing my point on another leaked email

They didn't though. The one thing they did in this direction that actually mattered was only scheduling 3 debates. It was wrong. They acknowledged that and fixed it. Bernie got the extra debates and got to grandstand on the issue and promote himself as the outsider. 

The real reason Bernie lost is that he made crappy decisions. He spent 30 years cocooned up in white as hell Vermont hardly ever coming into contact with a minority. That put him at a huge disadvantage in the South.

Then instead of trying to mitigate this problem, he conceded the entire South to Clinton. Not just a state in the South, the whole region. She ran up 60-70 point margins in an entire quadrant of the country in a race that allocates delegates proportionally. For anyone that understood math, that's when the race ended. Any of the leaked emails were way past that point when Sanders was still staying in the race and damaging Clinton by convincing his followers that he only lost because the DNC rigged it. 

He may or may not have been the stronger candidate against Trump. Personally, I don't think he was, but that doesn't matter. What matters is he certainly wasn't the stronger candidate in the primary. He lost because of his own choices.

> &quot;Australia has a strong track record in meeting its international obligations in regards to emissions reduction. Official figures show Australia beat its first Kyoto protocol emissions target and is on target to beat its 2020 emissions reduction target by 224m tonnes. Australia&#039;s emissions per capita and emissions per unit of GDP are at their lowest level in 27 years. Importantly emissions in the electricity sector have continued to fall, including 0.6% in the March quarter and 1.1% in the December quarter.""

Selon Vitalis Cros, dernier préfet de police d'Alger, les attentats de l'OAS ont été quatre fois plus nombreux de décembre 1961 à juin 1962 que ceux du FLN pendant six ans[57]. Quant au nombre de ses victimes, selon les chiffres d'un ouvrage collectif d'historiens français et algériens, s'il surpasse celui du FLN à Oran et à Alger en 1962, il est resté nettement inférieur jusqu'aux premiers mois de 1962, et son total d'ensemble est également moins élevé[58].

Le politologue américain Rudolph J. Rummelconsidère, lui, que le nombre de victimes s'élève à au moins 12 500 (12 000 civils et 500 membres des forces de l'ordre), estimation comparable à celle de Charles de Gaulle dans ses Mémoires d'espoir[réf. nécessaire]. L'historien Olivier Dard[59]estime ces bilans très exagérés.

Parmi les travaux récents, l'historien français Rémi Kauffer estime que l'OAS a assassiné entre 1 700 et 2 000 personnes[34],[60]. Le journaliste américain Paul Hénissart cite lui une source officieuse selon laquelle le nombre de victimes assassinées en Algérie s'élève à 2 200[61],[62]. L'historien français Guy Pervillé, s'appuyant sur deux rapports des forces de l'ordre (l'un de la Sûreté nationale, l'autre du général Fourquet, commandant supérieur des troupes françaises), et considérant l'« escalade de la violence » entre le printemps et l'été 1962, estime que ce chiffre est peut-être inférieur à la réalité[63]. Jean-Louis Planche donne le nombre de 1 622 morts dont 239 Européens[64].

> plus intéressant que de hurler qu’on va tous mourir et que plus rien n’est possible comme j’ai pu le voir un peu partout

C’est la difficulté de la communication vis à vis du changement climatique. D’un côté, la situation est extremêment grave et si on ne prends pas d’action, et bien sans aller jusqu’à « on va tous mourir » des millions de personnes périront des conséquences du réchauffement climatique (famines, etc.) Les engagements de la COP21 nous place sur une course à 3°C, et 3°C c’est un scénario catastrophe. D’un autre côté, il y a bien un chance pour nous de s’en sortir et de limiter le réchauffement climatique. 

Cependant, je pense qu’il faut vraiment noter à quel point l’échéance est courte et l’ampleur de la tâche grande. Les dix prochaines années sont décisives : si on ne réduit pas fortement nos émissions (possiblement de plus de 50%), on a aucune chance de limiter le réchauffement à 1,5-2°C — le quantité de CO2 à retirer ensuite de l’atmosphère rendrait tout projet de captation de la pure science-fiction.

Le langage du GIEC dans ce rapport est très fort ici. Il y a une phrase en particulier « limiting global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot would require **rapid and far-reaching transitions** in energy, land, urban and infrastructure (including transport and buildings), and industrial systems \[...\] **These systems transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale**, but not necessarily in terms of speed, and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors » qui je pense est à retenir absolument. Un changement est possible — il est même à priori nécessaire — mais il est *sans précédents*. Or, à l’heure actuelle, il n’y a rien qui montre une réelle volonté de la part des politiques ou des populations de se soumettre à de tels changements. Pour se donner une idée de leur ampleur, j’invite à consulter la page 33 du résumé pour les gouvernements, qui décrit quelques scénarios et leurs indicateurs clés. D’ici à 2030, il faudrait notamment augmenter le nucléaire dans le monde d’un facteur x1,5/x2 ou encore les énergies renouvelables d’un facteur x2-x5. Nous sommes très loin de tout ça, il faut vraiment espérer que la COP24 aboutisse à une véritable prise de conscience de l’urgence absolue qui existe.

En revanche si la COP24 aboutit de nouveau sur peu d’engagements, et bien là, il faudra vraiment commencer à hurler... 

> C’est déjà bon signe que le GIEC se soit accordé sur cet objectif

Juste un petit élément de langage : le GIEC ne choisit pas les objectifs ni le sujet de ses rapports. Ils sont commandités indirectement (par le biais de l’ONU) par les gouvernements du monde. Ainsi, il leur a ici été demandé explicitement de travailler sur le sujet d’un monde à 1,5°C — probablement que les climatologues préféreraient travailler sur le sujet d’un monde à 0°C, mais c’est un peu trop tard pour ça ! Il y a parfois un peu un message sous-jacent que le GIEC ajoute (par exemple ici ils poussent très fort pour que l’objectif ne soit pas changé à 2°C) mais jamais de position officiel.

En fait, ça ne serait pas vraiment possible, car ce ne correspond pas à des mesures chiffrées, mais à des concepts. Le processus est cependant assez rigoureux et représente du mieux possible l’état de l’art vis à vis du climat. En général quand la confiance est *moyenne*, cela signifie que le mécanisme de base est bien compris, mais qu’il y a des incertitudes importantes. Par exemple, dans le cas de la fonte des calottes polaires, c’est un phénomène très complexe qui peut très rapidement se retrouver hors-équilibre et dégénérer rapidement. Vu les niveaux d’incertitudes sur le climat en général, on peut facilement se retrouver d’un côté ou de l’autre de la balance. 

Parfois, c’est aussi car on ne sait pas bien quantifier les phénoménes. Pour la pluie par exemple, il y a une interaction très complexe entre les aérosols qui facilitent la formation de nuages, et la température moyenne qui est affecté par ses mêmes aérosols. Du coup c’est un sujet de recherche très actif que de savoir exactement ce qui se passe, et c’est complexe parce que les observations doivent être très rigoureuses pour limiter les incertitudes et qu’il faut beaucoup de ces observations à pleins d’échelles et d’endroits différents. 

On va donc dire que confiance moyenne c’est « on sait que le phénomène existe, mais on ne le connaît pas pleinement encore », tandis qu’une confiance élevé relève une meilleure compréhension du système. Le GIEC est souvent très conservatif dans ces rapports, car ce n’est clairement pas son but de démarrer une panique générale.

Oui, malheureusement, il y a peu d’espoir à avoir de ce coté là. Fait amusant (mais pas trop) : on a quasi-systématiquement dépassé systèmatiquement les pires scénarios du GIEC, ça en est presque insolent.

La fusion c'est sur que c'est pas dispo avant 2050. Si on atteint le super-optimisme de 70% d'électricité renouvelable. Il reste encore 30% a produire. Et temporairement, c'est mieux si c'est du nucléaire que du charbon qui assure ces 30%.

En fait, non. Dans les modèles sur lesquels le GIEC travaille et présent dans la version anglaise, on peut lire : "" All pathways use Carbon Dioxide
Removal (CDR), but the amount varies across pathways, as do the relative contributions of Bioenergy with
Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and removals in the Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU)
sector. This has implications for the emissions and several other pathway characteristics. "" 

En gros, on table sur des procédés de stockage et transformation du CO2, ces mesures amenant dans certains de leurs scénarios des productions négatives de CO2 à long terme (utile pour vider plus facilement l'océan et les autres stocks naturels des surplus qu'ils accumulent actuellement, et ainsi par exemple ralentir la montée des eaux).

Il est intéressant de voir que le GIEC parle rarement d’efforts personnels (je crois qu’il y en a une mention subtile à un endroit, mais c’est très léger). Plutôt, ils parlent de véritables changements de fond en comble de notre société et d’une adaptation de la population à ces changements. L’action individuel est clairement insuffisante, il faut un changement du système pour que l’individu est une chance de voir sa contribution faire effet. C’est là où j’ai plus d’espoir : il y a un précédent historique pour des changements très rapides dans notre société (révolutions, guerres, etc.) J’aimerais vraiment voir un mouvement de masse autour des problématiques climatiques.

Je pense que leur position sur le nucléaire est très raisonné. Ils reconnaissent qu’il y a des risques (pour moi celui de prolifération est le plus grand, et pourtant pas le plus médiatisé) mais acceptent ces risques au vu des enjeux du changement climatique. Le problème c’est qu’il n’y a pas de bonne solution : la bonne solution c’était d’écouter les climatologues il y a plus de 30-50 ans quand ils ont commencés à donner l’alerte, maintenant il est trop tard.

C'est un peu chaud car c'est surtout un truc que tu trouve dans les intro à l'aquariophilie, mais les coraux dur sont ceux avec un squelette de calcaire et sont vachement velu a garder en vie.

>En aquarium, les coraux mous exigent des paramètres d’eau moins contraignants que les coraux durs. Tous n’ont pas besoin d’un éclairage intensif et leur consommation en calcium et en magnésium est moins importante. Ils sont donc idéal pour débuter mais il reste nécessaire de se renseigner sur leurs besoins avant de les acheter. 

Dans tout les cas c'est chelou car les coraux mou font partie d'un recif coralien. Je pense qu'ils voulaient dire que les coraux durs vont plus ou moins disparaitre, (ce qui est déjà pratiquement le cas je crois https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blanchissement_des_coraux ), ce qui me parait techniquement possible, même si un peu tiré par les cheveux vu qu'il y a des coraux dur capable de resister mieux que la moyenne aux changements de temperature, acidité, calcium, ... mais bon j'y connais pas grand chose en matière de coraux dur n'en ayant jamais eu, donc je vais leur faire confiance.","{""2024-12-16T10:32:40"":1}",false,

La zone autour de Fukushima est toujours fortement irradiée, quoi que le gouvernement japonais prétende.

Existe-t-il un scenario ""tous les pays de l'OCDE font ce que la Fance a fait!"" ?    

> Nous devons choisir le meilleur du pire;     

Donc comme disait Corinne Lepage: ""les [sceptiques](http://www.sortirdunucleaire.org/EDF-super-menteur) nous ont fait perdre beaucoup de temps"" ?   

Si vous voulez que nous (les inge nucleaire) soyons capables de livrer les 59-83% necessaires, on va avoir besoin de votre soutien plus explicite.     


Les types qui ont fait l'enquete qui a conclu au consensus de 97% sur le changement climatique, tu peux pas leur demander de la refaire en demandant aux meme gens leur avis sur le nucleaire?     
On part de loin, [83%](http://huet.blog.lemonde.fr/files/2018/04/Opinion-sur-nucl%C3%A9aire-et-effet-de-serre.png) des jeunes pensent que le nucleaire est mauvais pour le climat (et ca augmente avec le temps).    
Tant que c'est nous les vendus du lobby nucleaire qui parlons, personne ne nous ecoutera, et encore moins ne nous croira; on a besoin de gens comme vous pour convaincre le bon peuple qu'on peut rendre service. Et surtout pour motiver les jeunes qui devront construire les centrales en remplacement dans 20 ans!     

C'est interessant ton point de vue sur la proliferation. Des 30 pays qui ont des centrales, seuls 8 environs ont la bombe, et ils l'ont quasiement tous eu avant d'avoir du nucleaire civil, ce qui contredit le rapport de cause a effet. Certains vont meme jusqu'a dire que la bombe a eu un effet pacificateur par rapport aux conflics conventionnels (cf les nombreuses guerres meurtrieres entre l'Inde et le Pakistan qui se sont taries depuis que les deux sont des puissances nucleaires). Loin de moi l'idee de filer la bombe a tout le monde, juste que centrale=bombe est pas un lien demontre.     

En pratique, les technologies a surveiller sont l'enrichissement (pour des bombes a l'uranium de type Hiroshima) et les reacteurs de recherche (pour generer du plutonium pour les bombes de type Nagasaki); pas les reacteurs de puissance. Je suis beaucoup plus inquiet de voir le Soudan se doter de reacteurs de recherche que de capacite elecrtrogene. Car le combustible use en sorti de reacteur est impropre a la creation de bombe; pour faire simple, il faut ""cuire"" le plutonium a petit feu et le retirer rapidement du reacteur (sinon il se fait empoisonner par d'autres isotope du Pu), et ca c'est beaucoup plus facile a faire avec des reacteurs de recherche qui se manipule tout les jours qu'avec des centrales (on voit immediatement si une centrale s'arrete tous les deux mois pour ""changer"" son combustible). Il y a aussi les reacteurs a rechargement en ligne (CANDU canadien et indien ou Magnox anglais) qui sont tres plutonigene pour les meme raisons et que je ne souhaite pas voir multiplier.    


Ensuite il ya l'argument des bombes sales: utiliser des dechets radioactifs comme poison a disseminer. C'est impraticable (et on le sais tres bien depuis longtemps, l'armee americaine y a reflechie au debut de l'aire nucleaire pour ""valoriser"" les dechets) car on ne peut pas ""eteindre"" la radioactivité à volonte, donc soit on a une quantite non negligeable de radioactivite mais alors il faut des protections pour construire et manipuler la bombe qui la rende impraticable (et pas discrete), soit on fait une bombe utilisable (qu'on peut monter sur un avion au mieux) mais alors la quantite de matiere dangereuse la rend inutile car elle contamine soit pas assez soit sur une zone minuscule.    


Le dernier risque est l'attaque terroriste, en particulier sur les transports de dechets. C'est pas negligeable, mais [on s'y prepare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBp1FNceTTA).

Pareil pour les bâtiments, ce serait très facile de réduire les émissions de GES du chauffage, techniquement on sait bien isoler, même en rénovation.

Après ça demande de l'investissement, mais rien de fou non plus. Et puis si on veut créer de l'emploi, un gros chantier de rénovation thermique étalé sur les 30 à 50 prochaines années, ça pourrait aider.

En fait cela correspond à tout les scénarios qui nous donnent une chance de limiter le réchauffement à 1,5°C. Ils prévoient tous une réduction des émissions de 90% d’ici à 2050, le problème c’est que cela concerne la planète entière est pas seulement les pays de l’OCDE — qui ont très certainement la capacité de diminuer leurs émissions de 90% pour ceux avec les mix énergétiques les plus carbonés. Ta remarque est d’ailleurs très pertinente : elle correspond à l’observation du GIEC que des transformations similaires ont déjà eu lieu dans des contextes particuliers, mais jamais à l’échelle de l’humanité toute entière. 

> Si vous voulez que nous (les inge nucleaire) soyons capables de livrer les 59-83% necessaires, on va avoir besoin de votre soutien plus explicite.

Ce rapport du GIEC marque déjà une évolution forte dans ce sens, je pense que c’est la première fois que la part du nucléaire est jugée si importante dans les scénarios. 

> On part de loin, 83% des jeunes pensent que le nucleaire est mauvais pour le climat (et ca augmente avec le temps).

Oui, c’est terrifiant d’entendre ce genre de choses. C’est vraiment signe que notre système éducatif ne fonctionne pas si bien, et que le niveau de culture scientifique moyen reste extraordinairement faible... 

> C'est interessant ton point de vue sur la proliferation. Des 30 pays qui ont des centrales, seuls 8 environs ont la bombe, et ils l'ont quasiement tous eu avant d'avoir du nucleaire civil, ce qui contredit le rapport de cause a effet. 

En fait, c’est juste que pour moi le risque d’accident est surmédiatisé : j’ai travaillé avec des gens du nucléaire, et c’est évident que dans des pays comme la France c’est très bien géré. (C’est d’ailleurs marrant que tu mentionnes les réacteurs canadiens, pour un de mes profs qui venait de l’IRSN c’était un cas typique de double-use civil/militaire). Le risque de la prolifération, sans forcément qu’il soit important, me semble insuffisamment discuté en comparaison, car les enjeux sont plus importants. 

Pour moi, le risque de prolifération par le nucléaire civil est extrêmement faible aujourd’hui. De même que l’est le risque terroriste, que tu mentionnes plus loin. Par compte, dans un futur où nous généralisons le nucléaire rapidement, et donnons accès à une telle technologie à de nombreux pays, cela change la donne, car ce n’est pas dit qu’il gère tout ça aussi bien que nous. Il faudra voir quel modèle est a adopté : quelque chose avec beaucoup d’ingérence, où l’on s’occupe de leur nucléaire pour eux intégralement (mais difficile à justifier sur le plan politique), ou quelque chose où les différents pays gardent un grand contrôle sur une infrastructure nucléaire qu’ils maîtrisent mal (et là, beaucoup plus gros risques d’accident, de terrorisme, de prolifération, ne serait-ce que parce que tu augmentes la surface d’attaque).

Mon focus sur l'OCDE est parceque même moi je suis pas chaud pour filer du nucleaire au Chad ou au Yemen, donc si tu as accès à un model, je testerais bien: courbe de CO2/kWh de la France des années 70-90 (sauf les super clean genre Iceland et Norway, evidement), efforts sur mobilité (-25% en emissions directe, production électrique constante avec déplacement des gains en conso+efficacité vers le parc EV) et alimentation (-50% de viande); et monté en puissance 40% renouvelables+60%gas pour les non-OCDE. Pas de stockage, pas de capture. Ca nous met loin du 1.5C?    


> je pense que c’est la première fois que la part du nucléaire est jugée si importante dans les scénarios.  


je pense aussi. jusqu'à maintenant, le mieux que je pouvais trouver dans le genre prise de position c'était [ça](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/graphics/images/Assessment%20Reports/AR5%20-%20WG3/Chapter%2007/07_figure_7.7.png).   

> Oui, c’est terrifiant d’entendre ce genre de choses.   

Oui, mais pour ça on a besoin de vous.    
Rends toi bien compte que si un parent ingé nucléaire propose à une classe de collège de visiter la centrale du coin il se prend une levée de bouclier de la part des profs et des parents qui vont hurler à la propagande et au lavage de cerveau.    
Nos gamins apprennent que si on leur demande, ils doivent répondre ""papa travaille dans l'électricité"" et surtout pas ""dans le nucléaire"" car sinon ils se font chambrer à la récré: ""ton père a filer le cancer à ma mamie!""    
Le message ne peut pas venir de nous; en tout cas pas avant un garant extérieur qui dira ""si, si, écoute ce qu'il a à dire"".    


Pour revenir à la prolifération, comme expliqué, c'est plus compliqué que centrales=bombes, ça explique peut-être pourquoi c'est moins abordé.   
Pour les CANDU ou autres, c'est juste flagrant quand on connais la physique qu'il y a derrière: ""mais, pourquoi vous avez besoin de remplacer votre combustible tous les mois .... ?"". Sans parler de l'eau lourde qu'ils ont besoin qui elle est indispensable à l'étape suivante: la bombe H.      
Perso, je serais pour un accors mondial qui interdirait ce genre de réacteur, au même titre que le contrôle des capacité d'enrichissement. En gros une short liste de pays autorisés à enrichire (ie ceux qui le font déjà) et vendre le combustible (et reprendre le combustible usé pour retraitement), et que des réacteurs de puissances sans rechargement en ligne.     

Les russes vendent du [clef en main](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421518304245): on design, on finance, on construit, on opère, on fournit le combustible, on récupère les déchêts (pour nos rapides), on partage l'argent de l'électricité. Et en cadeau on étend son emprise géopolitique. (et si tu veux des renouvelables, tu auras besoin de notre [gaz](http://www.gazpromexport.ru/en/statistics/) pour boucher les trous).    
Si les renouvelables ne livrent pas leurs promesses et qu'on a perdu notre savoir faire nucléaire, un grand dilemne se présentera à nous: on fait du fossile ou on laisse les russes ou les chinois construire chez nous?

Il faut savoir qu'il existe déjà des contrôles de ""comptabilité de matière"" qu'on appelle [safeguards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA_safeguards) dans le cadre de l'application du NPT. Ils sont très strictes et on doit démontrer la tracabilité de toute matière fissile.   
Pour la petite annecdote, j'ai bossé dans un labo qui utilisait des fibres optiques avec des mg de matière au bout (mélanger avec un scintillateur ça devient un détecteur de neutron), imagine une fibre optique de 0.5mm de diamètre avec une micro goute au bout. Un jour un étudiant a perdu un morceau de fibre optique, une 20n de personne de tout le labo a été réquisitionnée pour le chercher car sinon on devait déclarer une perte de matière fissile dans le cadre de nos safeguards.    


J'ai été choqué par la note sur les [leucémies](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_chapter5_table5_3.pdf) parceque ils se gardent bien de noter que si c'est vrai qu'on observe une augmentation des leucémie autour de certaines centrales/sites, on l'observe aussi autour de certaines centrales ... pas encore construite: [Results for adults did not show an increase in leukaemia and overall cancer incidence near operating nuclear power plants, but overall cancer incidence in the vicinity of **planned** nuclear power plants did appear to be increased in adults during 1974–2004.](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/304617/COMARE14threport.pdf).    
Il est aussi notable qu'ils signalent la ""waste legacy"" pour le nucléaire mais font complètement l'impasse des déchêts à attendre des renouvelables, comme s'ils n'existaient pas.

Je travaille pour un équipementier dans l'industrie automobile, et on est en train de finaliser un bâtiment nommé EC paintshop, EC pour ""energy compliant""

Dans les grandes lignes, le gouvernement anglais aide mon client--Nissan à financer un bâtiment peinture en l'échange de résultats concluants au regard de l'impact énergétique et du volume de déchets rejetés de l'usine.

Je vais pas rentrer dans les détails techniques, mais on a déjà fermé une grande partie du batiment le plus polluant et energivore de l'usine et de basculé la production dans notre bâtiment, qui possède toutes les technologies les plus performantes en économie d'énergie, non-toxicité et facilité de traitements des déchets.

La suite du plan est de profiter d'avoir l'ancien bâtiment au ralenti pour le rénover et obtenir l'ensemble du parc machines ""eco friendly"".

Le projet à été initié après la cop21, ça fait deux ans que je bosse dessus dont la dernière année chez les anglais à régler des machines. 

La conso de peinture est réduite de 50%, l'utilisation de solvants pétroliers réduites de plus de 95%, l'électricité de 25% depuis juillet, mise en production du nouveau bâtiment. J'y reste jusqu'à mars où on aura fini de s'occuper de l'ancien bâtiment 

Le projet total est de 120 millions, 30 seront payés par le gouvernement anglais dans quelques mois grâce aux résultats obtenus.

Juste pour finir: dans la peinture automobile bien que l'investissement initial soit beaucoup plus grand il est économiquement préférable de choisir les solutions les plus écologiques car c'est celles qui permettent d'économiser le plus de peinture et de solvant, qui sont des produits très coûteux. De plus la plupart des gouvernements européens appliquent des taxes liées au volume de déchets rejetés. 

Les constructeurs ont donc doublement intérêt à gâcher le moins de produit possible, optimiser, investir, changer de technologies.","{""2024-12-16T10:32:58"":7}",false,

Une usine automobile c'est un énorme complexe comprenant du côté production pur et dur 4 gros bâtiments: logistique/stockage, tôlerie, peinture, montage. Ensuite, soit ils achètent le restant des pièces ailleurs, soit c'est un bâtiment mineur, soit il est intégré dans un autre des gros coeurs (fonderie et UGV, étanchéité sous caisse, pièces plastiques, conduites de liquide de freins, moulage et peinture de pare-chocs, ect). A côté de ça on rajoute tout ce qui est administratif, ingénierie, comptable, achats et plein d'autres conneries mais ces derniers mais on s'en fout royalement pour la suite. 

Produire 3 fois plus qu'avant c'est multiplier tous les bâtiments production par 3. C'est bien beau de POUVOIR peindre 3x plus de caisses, mais comment je la peint si elle n'a physiquement pas pu être fabriquée en tôlerie car le bâtiment ne sait pas produire autant ? Comment je peint 3x plus de caisses, si le montage sera complétement saturé car lui ne sait pas assembler autant de véhicules ? Comment je fais pour monter toutes ces voitures si je ne sais pas produire 3x plus de pare-chocs, si mes fournisseurs ne savent pas produire 3x plus de moteurs? Comment je peint 3x plus de caisses si de toute façon on ne m'a pas acheté subitement 3x de voitures ?

Et de toute façon, même si c'était possible, je les gare où toutes ces voitures avant qu'elles ne quittent l'usine ? Il va falloir acheter et mettre du bitume sur combien d'hectares ? Et comment la logistique fait pour gérer une telle augmentation des fluxs entrants et sortants, autans en terme de stockage que d'entréées et sorties produits ?

Concrètement ce qu'il se passe:

Il y avait jusque là six lignes de peinture. Et nous avons installé deux nouvelles lignes.

Deux lignes neuves arrivent à absorber quatre anciennes, il n'y a donc plus que deux anciennes en production.

Nous allons ensuite faire une nouvelle ligne À LA PLACE d'une qui est à l'arrêt et cette ultime ligne sera capable d'absorber et arrêter les deux dernières vieilles lignes encore en production. 

Déstitution complète des lignes obsolètes, c'est le ferrailleur du coin le plus heureux de l'histoire. 

Bilan à terme: ils ne produisent ni plus ni moins, ont drastiquement limité l'impact écologique de chaque ligne (consommation d'une ancienne vs une nouvelle) et ont en plus divisé le nombre de lignes par deux.

L'effet *les conspirations et spéculations ça va bien 5 minutes*

Edit: quelques reformulations que j'ai trouvé meilleures après coup, et surtout j'aime bien me préter au jeu, faisons donc l'éxercice: 

ADMETTONS que le méchant constructeur veuille juste soustirer un peu de thunes pour pourvoir produire 3x plus. Comparons l'état de l'usine y'a un an et le cas que vous évoquez:


Données:


Quantité de peinture utilisée pour peindre une voiture: maintenant: 5L / anciennement: 10L. 

Nombre de caisses à l'année: dans votre fiction: 1 500 000 / anciennement : 500 000 (mais pour le coup ça reste et restera la vraie production donc il faut comprendre que les consommations actuelles et futures sont et seront largement plus faibles)

Une peinture c'est en général 25% de solvants (pétroliers), et comme dit plus haut on a diminué de 90% la consommation sur les nouvelles lignes.

J'avais pas envie de rentrer dans le technique, mais vous allez me dire blahblahblah 90% cépapossible. Ben si, grâce au passage d'une peinture créée sur une base de solvants à une peinture sur une base hydro (oui, de l'eau, de la gouache en plus industriel quoi). Ce qui fait que l'utilisation de solvant pétrolier est quasi nulle dans la composition en soit de la peinture, mais aussi pour son nettoyage. Avant, il y avait vraiment besoin du pétrole pour décaper, maintenant c'est plutôt un mélnge de flotte et de savon qu'autre chose.

Je pourrais aussi parler de la technologie de pulvérisation en soit permettant d'économiser drastiquement la quantité de produit de nettoyage, de pourquoi il y a encore un peu de solvant et que *pour le moment* on ne sait pas s'en passer, des avancées qui ont été faites d'un point de vue du convoyage pour faire les plus grands ""train de caisses"" possible, permettant sur de grandes séries de peindre toujours la même couleur et donc d'éviter de nettoyer les conduits au solvant pour changer de couleur, et donc d'éviter d'utiliser de consommer tout ce pétrole, l'amélioration considérable du taux de transfert. Mais tout ça, on en parlera dans une prochaine vidéo, lache un pouce bleu, tipeee FB twitter, mais surtout tipeee. 

Petite mention spéciale et sérieuse sur le laveur: dans une cabine de peinture industrielle et traditionnelle le laveur fait référence à la rivière de solvant coulant sous l'installation, qui récupère et permet de  traiter le nuage de peinture qui retombe. Niveau déchets et traitement c'est l'enfer mais c'était la seule solution jusqu'à récemment. Dans les installations mentionnées ici, le laveur est constitué de chaux dans lequel va se mélanger cette peinture. Eeet la chaux intéresse énormément les cimenteries et elle leur est revendue au taux de pureté qui leur convient (pour eux le type d'impureté n'a pas d'importance). On passe donc ici d'une littérale rivière de white spirit dont le traitement est long, complèxe, à un recyclage naturel de 100% des retombées

Les prochains paragraphes vont être subtilement teintés d'ironie, je préviens pour ceux qui lisent en diagonale

Revenons sur le sujet: Le méchant Nissan en mode super sayen x3 utilise -à l'arrondi près- 185 mille litres de solvant pétrolier à l'année, et l'ancien système cool en utilise 1 MILLION et 250 mille litres. Donc pour produire de facon nauséabonde 3x plus de véhicules, le nouveau système utilise 6x *moins* de solvant. C'est vraiment des salauds quand même. Et en plus ils n'utilisent quasiment plus de produits toxiques. Et le peu de déchets à traiter est ultra simple. Où va le monde ?

Et vu que c'est plus facile à traiter, ben ils subissent largement moins de taxes, et ils s'y retrouvent, donc ça les motive. Le système est tellement mal foutu qu'ils perdent moins de sous à investir pour moins poluer que de continuer leurs conneries. Mais vraiment ils ne pensent qu'à leur porte feuille ces gens là ils me rendent hors de moi. En plus quand  réellement ils investissent dans des projets sur plusieures années pour être clean ils payent du coup moins de taxes sur ces déchêts *qu'ils ne rejettent plus*. Hors de moi ça me met. (premier post pour les gens du fond, encore)

En dehors de ca, ben tout le process à évolué depuis leurs anciennes installations. Prennons l'air comprimé, très utilisé dans ce milieu. C'est une énergie qui est très chère à produire, il faut beaucoup d'électricité pour constamment aspirer l'air ambien et arriver à maintenir une pression élevée. Là, au lieu d'être constamment alimentée et gâchée, les vannes s'ouvrent uniquement quand il y en a besoin. L'électricité ? Capteurs de mouvements tous les deux mètres pour l'éclairage - à LEDS. Le principe d'utilisation de l'énergie uniquement quand il y en a besoin est respecté et contrôlé dans tous les domaines: fours, convoyage, ventilation ect: isolation et régulation à la pointe de ce qui peut se faire actuellement afin de ne rien gaspiller. 

Je reviens sur la comparaison faite sur le post initial et j'irais même plus loin: même si ils arrivaient à multiplier par 5 leur production (malgré l'investissement impenssablement débile que ca représenterait) ils arriveraient toujours avec le nouveau système à être plus écologique ET économiquement rentable sur le très long terme que ce qu'ils avaient avant.

Ah tiens on va y rajouter un peu d'humain parceque je hais les gens. Les peintres manuels qui passaient leur temps à respirer du solvant, à se taper des TMS à force de faire les même mouvements toute la journée et littéralement être à virés parcequ'ils n'avaient plus ni poumons, ni jambes, ni bras à presque 50ans, ben ces prolos dégueulasses là ils sont tous prévus pour gérer les machines maintenant. Plus d'athmosphère toxique, de mouvements répétitifs, un mais un travail de reporting, d'entretien, de gestion, varié, en environnement non aggressif. En plus ils vont devoir être formés et passer au statut de technicien plutôt que de grouillot au smig, donc ils vont être augmentés.

Donc votre critique c'est quoi ? Bouh méchante multi-nationnale, vous produisez plus en étant plus écolos, en améliorant les conditions de travail et le salaire de vos employés, et en embauchant à tour de bras ? SALAUDS !

De ce que j'ai compris, on prend tout le CO2 absorbé par la Terre à l'heure actuelle (océans et continents) et on divise par le nombre d'habitants. Donc c'est un calcul basique pour atteindre la neutralité carbone.

Sauf que ça marche pas parce que si on diminue nos émissions, la Terre absorbera moins de CO2. Eh oui, plus le CO2 est concentré dans l'atmosphère, plus il est absorbé. Donc même si on atteint cet objectif, on n'aura pas du tout de neutralité carbone. À quel moment on l'aura ? je n'ai rien trouvé à ce sujet. J'ai lu un peu le rapport du GIEC et ils disent que le carbone est très volatile et que la moindre concentration est un problème, et que pour ainsi dire il faudrait arrêter complètement d'en émettre. La seule source chiffrée que j'ai à ce sujet est la [contentration du CO2 dans l'Histoire](https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth103/sites/www.e-education.psu.edu.earth103/files/module05/image005.png), et on voit que sa concentration a augmenté à partir du début du  XIXe siècle. Donc le dernier moment de l'Histoire où on n'a pas trop pollué est littéralement le XVIIIe siècle. Donc si on doit arrêter la pollution dans le futur et limiter notre niveau de vie pour ça, la seule chose dont on soit 100% sûr est qu'on ne descendra au-dessous du niveau de vie du XVIIIe siècle, tout le reste n'est que pure spéculation.","{""2024-12-16T10:03:13"":3}",false,

Parce que comme tu le dis, les initiatives politiciennes qu'on a eues jusqu'ici n'ont servi à rien. Sauf que dans le même temps, le coup de la responsabilité individuelle on l'a essayé, c'est même ce qu'on nous rabat à longueur de journée depuis vingt ans : consommez local, éteignez le robinet, évitez la voiture individuelle, prenez moins l'avion... Et clairement ça n'est pas plus efficace. Entre un confort objectif et immédiat, et la vague possibilité d'améliorer imperceptiblement les choses dans le futur, il est absurde d'attendre des gens qu'ils choisissent le second.

En fait ce raisonnement est faillible à deux niveaux. D'une part, quand tu dis que les gens doivent ""voter avec leur argent"", tu attends d'eux qu'ils aillent à l'encontre d'un système de conditionnement affectif extrêmement puissant, et qui détermine depuis leur naissance leurs envies et leurs besoins. D'expérience, depuis les travaux de Bernays, c'est très difficile à l'échelle de la masse.

Et surtout, demander aux gens de réduire leur propre confort, c'est irrationnel au niveau individuel. C'est une sorte de dilemme du prisonnier si tu veux : un individu A n'a aucun impact à lui seul sur les émissions totales, et il le sait. Donc de deux choses l'une :

- Soit la population continue à polluer. L'individu A peut soit décroître son niveau de vie et ne rien changer, soit le maintenir. Le résultat final est le même donc il n'a aucune raison de faire un sacrifice.

- Soit la population a un sursaut et réduit drastiquement sa consommation. La planète est sauvée, et notre individu A n'a aucune raison de décroître lui aussi son niveau de vie, dont l'impact est dans tous les cas négligeable.

Proposer des solutions individuelles à des problèmes systémiques, c'est irrationnel et empiriquement inefficace. Si il y a une issue, elle se trouve, comme dans le cas du dilemme du prisonnier, dans la coordination d'une réponse et dans la mise en place de contraintes environnementales objectives (parce que jusque-là, au niveau des COP comme au niveau des individus, tout ce qu'on a c'est des contraintes morales) ; c'est bien une réponse politique, mais qui doit être radicale et qui est sans doute incompatible avec les modèles existants. Bien sûr, il reste vrai que cela demanderait là aussi d'aller à l'encontre de nos conditionnements, et mon ""si"" en est donc un très gros. Mais cela élimine au moins le problème des échelles de rationalité.

Donc effectivement, depuis les années 50 on voit que notre classe politique ne réagit pas. Mais il me paraît dangereux d'en déduire que c'est un problème du fait politique, quand tout semble indiquer que c'est un problème lié à un type de politique particulier, à savoir le capitalisme libéral.

Donc c'est effectivement quelque chose qu'il faut encourager, et trop de gens s'en prennent aux ""colibris"" alors que eux au moins, ont un impact direct sur ces questions là.

Tu peux trouver une de mes vieilles explications ici : https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/azspp2/can_economic_growth_continue_indefinitely_or_is/

J'ai la flemme de faire une réponse complète à ton message, mais il est complètement en dehors du consensus scientifique, désolé. Je vais cependant répondre à certains points :

> Quelques experts économiques Facebook, voulant nier les faits et trouver la petite bête, essayent de nous faire croire qu’on peut avoir de la Croissance en ne vendant que des services, avec plus de valeur ajoutée, sans pour autant plus polluer

En l'occurrence, ce ne sont pas les ""experts économiques Facebook"" mais l'ensemble du consensus scientifique, dont des médaillés Nobel comme Krugman, Solow, Nordhaus, Romer, Weissman ou n'importe quel économiste environnemental qui sont d'accord avec ce fait.

> Pour les derniers récalcitrants, intéressons-nous aux chiffres : existe-il une corrélation entre la croissance du PIB et la croissance des émissions de CO² ? La preuve en image. Une corrélation de seulement 0.9. Même un enfant de 5 ans comprendrait en regardant ce graphique.

Tu inverses complètement la causalité. On a moins d'émissions de CO2 quand on a moins d'activité économique, ça n'est en aucun cas une preuve qu'on ne peut pas avoir plus d'activités économiques sans émissions de CO2.

Jancovici n'est pas un économiste, ce n'est donc pas une source fiable pour parler d'économie.

Pour info, on a déjà des modèles qui prévoient quel serait l'impact sur l'économie de changements pareils. Le modèle DICE prévoit des coûts qui ont un pic à 2% du PIB, et qui redescendent ensuite pour 1.5°C (http://webdice.rdcep.org/advanced#graph:economy) et la literature review plus récente de [Gillingham, Stock (2018)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.32.4.53) prévoit des abatement costs similaires. L'IPCC confirme a aussi des estimations semblables dans son dernier rapport.

Stiglitz ne dit absolument pas ce que tu dis, il dit **exactement l'inverse** :

But there is ample room to change the quality of growth, to reduce its environmental impact significantly. For example, even without major technological advances, we can achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.1

> But it won’t happen on its own, and it won’t happen if we just leave it to the market. It will happen only if we combine high levels of public investment with strong regulation and appropriate environmental pricing. And it can’t, or won’t, happen if we put the burden of adjustment on the poor: environmental sustainability can be achieved only in tandem with efforts to achieve greater social justice.

Tous les économistes environnementaux utilisent ce modèle ou un modèle dérivé de ce modèle. William Nordhaus a 66416 citations et un h-index de 112 (google scholar).

Le rapport de Meadows n'a pas été écrit par des économistes. Tu peux lire Solow (1973) qui en parle pour expliquer pourquoi c'est n'importe quoi, ou mon court résumé [ici](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskEconomics/comments/eax0i5/limits_to_growth/fayt68y/).

Pardon ? Je ne fait que te citer des chiffres depuis le début. La neutralité carbone, c'est 2% du PIB en abatement costs. Je t'ai cité Nordhaus (1993) et Gillingham & Stock (2018), mais il y a d'autres abatement cost curves comme McKinsey (2009).

Prenons l'exemple des États-Unis, pays fortement émetteur, aussi bien à l'échelle individuelle que nationale. Les comportements individuels jouent-ils un rôle important ici ? Oui, c'est clair ! Comparé au français lambda, un américain possède plus de voitures par foyer, celles-ci consomment plus, il prend plus souvent l'avion, mange plus de viande, et consomme plus de manière générale...

Mais maintenant, essayons d'imaginer ce qu'un Américain moyen pourrais faire pour baisser son empreinte carbone. 

- Le plus simple serait de baisser la consommation de viande, mais ce n'est pas le seul impact du régime alimentaire américain sur l'environnement ; les grandes surfaces américaines offrent peu de choix en termes de légumes et produits frais, la plupart des produits sont des plats préparés ou autres ""processed foods"" qui contiennent de grandes quantités de sirop de maïs, un dérivé de plante tropicale cultivée en majorité dans des régions arides des US (consommant donc énormément d'eau) qui est fortement soutenu par les lobbies.

- En termes de mobilité, difficile de se mettre au transports en commun. La plupart des villes sont conçues de A à Z pour la voiture : grands boulevards, routes énormes, autoroutes au milieu de la ville. Elles sont donc un cauchemar à traverser à pied, et difficiles à quadriller pour un réseau de transport type bus/métro. De plus, comme les transports en commun sont peu pratiques, peu de gens les prennent et ils restent donc peu développés. C'est un cercle vicieux...
En zone rurale, c'est pas beaucoup mieux. La voiture est indispensable (comme en France).
Pour ce qui est des longs trajets, le transport ferroviaire de passager est sous-développés aux US. Le réseau ferroviaire est pensé pour le transport de marchandises, qui est considéré comme prioritaire. Les lignes à grande vitesse sont inexistantes et, faute d'investissement des Etats et du gouvernement fédéral, sont parties pour le rester. Prendre la voiture pour visiter les Etats voisins et l'avion pour les Etats lointains est donc considéré comme la norme.

- Pour ce qui est de la consommation d'énergie, il est évidemment possible de la réduire. Les Américains font souvent un usage abusif de l'air conditionné, par exemple. Leurs maisons sont parfois mal isolées ou alors avec des matériaux très cheap. Mais même en réduisant la facture d'électricité au niveau de celle d'un européen, cela ne change pas le fait que cette électricité provient très majoritairement de sources fossiles. Même un américain qui fait très attention émettra toujours plus de CO2 via l'électricité qu'un français qui s'en fout.

En résumé, l'engagement individuel est nécessaire mais pas suffisant. On finit toujours par heurter un mur, car notre empreinte carbone individuelle dépend fortement de décisions prises à l'échelle collective et donc, politiques. Si les politiciens ne font rien pour nous permettre de réduire nos émissions, il sera très difficile d'atteindre nos objectifs. Et d'un autre coté, si les électeurs sont plus intéressés par leur pouvoir d'achat que par les enjeux écologiques, les politiciens ne vont rien faire au détriment du premier au nom du second. Ce qu'il faut, c'est que tout le monde 1.souhaite du changement en ce qui concerne notre relation à l'environnement et 2.réalise que ce changement impliquera certainement une légère baisse du niveau de vie ou, tout du moins, de modifier drastiquement nos propres habitudes.","{""2024-12-16T10:03:08"":1}",false,

So, yup, this may make sense in terms of sustainably produced products, but not for actual sequestration.

I know it's heretical, but there is an off chance that just making plastic from O&G and then securely landfilling it at end-of-life-cycle is equivalent or better in terms of overall emissions. Strange as that may be.

(Note, I'd prefer hemp to more O&G extraction. But my point is we need to do some careful accounting to determine best options, not let our preferences and assumptions get in the way.)

I just read a great comment by /r/ElegantBiscuit that fits nicely as a response for *only* automotive revenue. 

I have absolutely no plans on selling TSLA this decade. 

I'll paste the comment here: 

Let's run through a basic and simplified scenario with our known variables, on just vehicles alone. Not including future energy storage (massive potential), without FSD revenue realization or any autonomous vehicle progression or revenue, without tesla insurance, before semi / cybertruck / roadster / compact production, just today's existing numbers scaled up to represent production a few years in the future. 

30% margin on vehicles sold, $48k average selling price, ~80% YOY production growth (proves support for future production ramping) with a stated 20M/year production target run rate by 2030 but lets just say its 10M, so about as many cars as toyota makes today. I would call these very conservative assumptions, given Tesla's increasing operating efficiency, proven track record of growth and production capabilities and innovation, and lead over the competition, but lets keep going.

That would be a future profit of $144B per year. Now let's use a VERY conservative (for a company like tesla) market average P/E of 20, that's a $2.88T valuation right there. For reference, Tesla's P/E today is 361, Nvidia is 100, Amazon 70, Microsoft 38, Apple 29. If we go with something a little more reasonably suited to a tech based high growth company like 35, keeping in mind the very conservative constraints of this calculation, that is a valuation of $5.04T based solely on car production and almost nothing else. Over 9 years that is 500% returns, or a CAGR of 19%, consistently, for 9 years.

Now throw back into the mix tesla energy and the great potential with autobidder, insurance, FSD, higher margins and better operating efficiency, 4680 batteries, future vehicle market segments, and you got yourself a money printer if you're holding the stock through the years.","{""2024-12-16T10:26:40"":2}",false,

Your statement is incorrect. Your own source is conflicting with it. Did you even read it? From your source:

Biomass is a renewable energy source (https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/biomass/#:~:text=Biomass%20is%20renewable%20organic%20material,consumption%20until%20the%20mid%2D1800s.) according to the EIA, the same organization you're getting your other data from. 

Additionally, the EIA source you linked has India at 1% hydroelectric (renewable) and 1% nuclear (non-renewable, but clean energy).

So really, India is at ~~21%~~22% total renewables. Yes, the non-renewable percentage is high, but it's not because of greed. India is not a wealthy country. People will do worse to keep the lights on.

https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-which-countries-are-historically-responsible-for-climate-change

In other words: If you take the average enissions of the average Brit, German, French, Italian or even Russian and add them all up since 1850, that number won't be that much higher than that of many developing countries. In fact, you won't find a single European country in the top 20 (link above). -> cumulative per capita emissions

If, however, you just add up all emissions since 1850 and devide that cumulative total number by the current day population, it'll make countries that had a much smaller population in the past (= less emissions) look better today. -> cumulative emissions per capita

For example, in 1850 there were 34 million Germans around but only 23 million Americans. The German emissions of 1850 look way bigger than they were compared to the American emissions if we divide them by the current day population (83 million Germans vs 330 million Americans) simply because back then there were more Germans around relatively speaking.

Or put another way, since people often still don't get it: Compared to the America of 1850, the Germany at the time looked like a country of 488 million people (=34 / 23 x 330 million).

Or in the extreme case: Countries like Canada, NZ and Australia had extremely high per capita emissions that are now ""invisible"" because back in the day they were almost empty.

EDIT: Europe(an elites) fucked the world with colonization, ressource extraction and the creation of the current carbon based economy though.

I can’t speak to TMX, but the Costal Gaslink is likely going to be good for the climate.

Sorry, I seem to have been thrown off because of what it says in the text right above the graph:

>Lazard’s latest annual Levelized Cost of Energy Analysis (LCOE 15.0) shows **the continued cost-competitiveness of certain renewable energy technologies on a subsidized basis** and the marginal cost of coal, nuclear and combined cycle gas generation. 

If they are also cost-competitive on a non-subsidized basis, this seems like odd phrasing. 


> The first graph shows the unsubsidized costs for new build solar and wind are cheaper than new build fossil and fission.


And it also seems to assume an 8% cost of debt and 12% cost of equity, which seems a pretty damn high assumption given interest rates over the past several decades. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding this? 

>There was not one single mention of carbon emissions being factored into the energy source cost analysis in the link I posted.

Well... page 5 does explicitly discuss carbon pricing and attempts to account for it for coal & gas.

>Renewables have already won the race. It's only old men like you shouting at the clouds as progress passes you by.

I'm actually all for renewables, it was just my understanding that they weren't quite as cheap as natural gas yet once you exclude the subsidies.","{""2024-12-16T10:02:54"":1}",false,

India was a patchwork of states with fierce autonomy. Autonomy that is still strong today. The strongest states like Maharashtra, TN and Karnataka have enough economic clout to hold the Central Govt hostage. They also have strong linguistic and cultural independence from the rest of the nation.

China, with it's communist party, was able to bypass the whole, 'dealing with state quarrels' thing, and was able to streamline infrastructure building much faster. Single government means you can plan in the long term instead of worrying about elections and public perceptions.

I had to do a research project for my electrical engineering degree, and nearly all of china infra went from finishing planning to construction in 3 months or less. The same project would go through a TON of red tape, environment, people's welfare, finance control boards. It would take 5 years to get the seal of approval.

They acquired land with severe measures, and displaced people without much thought. Swiftly building high speed rail infrastructure and unifying the power companies and nationalizing them

If the central government pulled the same shit in say, Tamil Nadu, they would have a rebellion on their hands. They did actually try to do that in 1985 with the construction of a dam that would displace several million people, and it ended up going nowhere due to public resistance.

They tried to bring a single language policy and force hindi on everyone. The South retaliated with riots. In the end, the government changed the constitution and had to give 22 languages official status.

China has done this, and has made mandarin supreme. 

But i like my culture, and language and don't want it to die.

To be honest, i'm in a dilemma. Chinese way of brute forcing was much better for the economy, but it would mean states lose all autonomy, and become vassals to the federal government. I can't say either system is better.","{""2024-12-16T10:01:52"":5}",true,

In fact - the air is so polluted , out of 30 of the worlds most polluted cities in the world- 21 are in India. The life expectancy in India is effected by it - just from air pollution, minus ten years.

Probably - because the poor and lower caste deal with most of the issues around raw sewage, trash, rodents, disease, etc - it won’t be dealt with.

The more I think about it, the more I think it was completely unavoidable. The real problem is overshoot.

All living creatures can get into overshoot, there have been countless examples through history : [cyanobacteria, Kaibab plateau deer, Saint-Paul island reindeer, yeast eating all the sugar before dying when we make beer](https://old.reddit.com/r/collapse/comments/wvtvrg/understanding_the_root_cause_of_our_predicament/). 

We had all the ingredients necessary to get into overshoot. Our large brains, opposable thumbs, ability to sweat, to communicate and to use tools make us the most apex predators the earth has ever seen. We just aren't a very sustainable species because we are too successful for our own good. If life wants to sustain itself in its environment, it needs to be kept in check. No one is keeping us in check, we have no predators, we have medicine saving us from disease, artificial fertilizers producing a shit ton of food... Tool use, agriculture, civilization, colonization, capitalism, the industrial revolution were all accelerating factors toward overshoot. 

We are also very arrogant, we invented so many belief systems that made us think that we were distinct from other life forms, whether it's culture, religion or the Paris agreement. They all served as justification to keep our destructive behavior going. Like we couldn't get into overshoot, and that the laws of nature didn't apply to us.

Going to the past would not have changed anything. We got repeated warning throughout the years that our behavior was going to backfire, and no one ever listened. Malthus warned us about overpopulation in 1798, [We were warned about climate change in 1847](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2011/jun/20/george-perkins-marsh-climate-speech), Limits to Growth was published in 1972, Overshoot in 1980.

An “emissions intact RAM 2500 gets 30% less fuel economy than an “emissions defeated” RAM 2500. While it *does* produce less emissions at the tailpipe, and I would not argue otherwise, the reduction in fuel economy is just shifting the pollution upstream. We’re extracting more petroleum and refining more diesel to make up the difference. 

Further, the “diesel exhaust fluid” (DEF) necessary for their operation has significant emissions attributed to its production and transport. That’s before we even begin to discuss the mountains of plastic waste in the form of jugs left behind at gas stations and parts stores.

It’s also worth noting that all the giant container ships that bring all your products from China don’t have these decided and can freely vent hydrocarbons into the atmosphere.

This is true, but also don't underestimate the ingenuity of humans. We do have the technology to feed the entire population if we care about that, it will be only plant based products, and won't be the healthiest at first (much like the early 1900s as the animal slaughterhouse logistics were optimized for animal protein consumption and the side effects of that policy became apparent)

>Our growth was an extreme abnormality, and so will be the fall. And in both the growth and fall we've managed to destroy much of the world around us in our entitlement.

I still think a MAD nuke war is the only way that happens. Climate change will still tend to cause people to help their neighbors, we'll see more cooperation than conflict as our resource supplies collapse, but humans tend to help other humans who need help if they can. It's only governments that allow large groups of people to die without trying to help them

Not to be edgelordy, but the idea in the matrix that humans are a virus or a cockroach is true enough. We are here because we've collectively survived everything that has come before. All it takes is enough people to sustain a breeding population. Society takes a lot more people, skilled people who can run and maintain infrastructure. Those skills are more common than many people realize

So now that is the Obama years where he wants a new Kyoto as his stamp, First there is the disastourous CoP in Cophenhagen where the CoP system almost falls apart except for a stupid plea from the president of the Maldives to keep it alive, so you have the Copehagen accords in 09 that basically says we are going to keep trying and should have something by 15. 

So Obama enters that CoP in Paris determined to come up with something to sign and he scopes everything in such language that is not a treaty. Nothing binding, just goals no penalties, nothing. Just a vision board that people act like is a treaty, all because the Republicans control the Senate in 15, and they have made it clear that nothing is getting done for Obama. 

That is the main reason why Paris agreement specifically sucks.There are more reasons why all of these agreements are doomed, many of which are laid out in OP's post.","{""2024-12-16T10:30:23"":5}",false,

The 28x number is actually an average of typical methane release and breakdown over a 100 year span, with its strongest potential early on (because it's a half life, so there's much more initially). But that number assumed both release amounts and breakdown rate, something that is rapidly changing. You've certainly read about methane leaks both manmade and natural from warming. Climate change is also affecting the radicals that break down methane in the upper atmosphere. So more leaks, less breakdown...that average is totally wrong to consider how methane in the air is affecting us right now. It's more on the 100+ times CO2.

And of course the sick joke is that when it does break down eventually, it breaks into CO2 and water vapor, both GHGs, so it never goes away, just gets less effective.","{""2024-12-16T10:30:19"":12}",false,

At first, I was content with the most basic explanations for ""where it all went wrong"": money in politics, partisanship, big business controlling everything, etc.  But the more I dug around, the less satisfying those answers felt.  Then came the next series of a-ha! moments: it's illegal finance/big banks, the whole system is rigged, no...it's *capitalism itself*.  On and on, into...greed?  ""Human nature?""  Was it agriculture that did us in, is it genetic and unavoidable?

None of it explained to my satisfaction the thing I've always found *most weird* about our collective problems: why does it *keep* happening?  No matter how (un)educated the population, no matter how lush (or scarce) the resource circumstances, there's this constant rise and fall, rise and fall...one fall begets another rise.  We keep repeating the same mistakes regardless of how much we know about history.  What the hell is *that* about?

Apropos of nothing, some folks here have mentioned Nate Hagens' podcast (The Great Simplification), which is absolutely fantastic.  I watch him a lot on YouTube, and the Almighty Algorithm floated up a series he's doing with Daniel Schmachtenberger that absolutely blew my tits off: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bxzo79SjpE

There's a lot covered there (and in the following 2 videos), but one of Daniel's stand-out points is on the idea that we are stuck in a civilization-scale ""multipolar trap,"" which is essentially the ""crabs in a bucket"" mentality but some crabs have nukes.  But this isn't just limited to worldending weapons, these same steady-state game theory constructs pop up a *lot* in human societies at all scales.  It seems like it's a pattern we're prone to getting stuck in.  I'd like to think that shaved apes as adaptable *and persistent* as us can recognize and learn to avoid these patterns, just as our predecessors learned about brightly-colored-but-poisonous insects.  We've got the hardware for this, we just gotta work out the software.

One of Schmachtenberger's takes is that we need to find a solution to the multipolar trap problem.  Right now, the our civilization is locked into a mode of runaway consumption that is out of control so long as the stalemate of incentives persists and approaching a terminus that will break that stalemate *for us.*  If we can find another way, to look at the big *big* picture and create the cascade of incentives necessary to solve these deadlocks, we might have worked out a way forward.

So far, this is where I've come on my ""Why?"" journey, and if nothing else it at least feels like I'm moving in the right direction, and that's *something*.","{""2024-12-16T10:29:41"":16}",false,
