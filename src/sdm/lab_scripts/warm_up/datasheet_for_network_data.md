## Motivation

__For what purpose was the dataset created?__ _Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description._
=> The network dataset is created as part of the course 'Mining of Social Data' at Uppsala University. The main purpose of this dataset is to further the learning of the authors as part of the course. It also serves as a source of information to analyze visual persuasion on Twitter.

The main learning outcomes from creating the dataset are as follows:

- Generate datasets to be used for other learning activities during the course.
- Familiarise with typical data formats.
- Identify and reflect on data quality and validity issues.
- Practice the documentation of social data.

__Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)?__
=> The dataset was created by Anand Mathew M S and Finn Vaughankraska as part of the course 1DL465 'Mining of Social Data' at Uppsala University under the instruction set presumably created by Prof. Matteo Magnani.

__Who funded the creation of the dataset?__ _If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number._
=> Since the dataset was created as part of an academic course, there is no funding involved to the authors. However, since both the authors are fee-paying students enrolled in this programme, an argument could be made that the dataset is funded by the authors. 

The original data was funded as part of the *PolarVis* project. The supporters of PolarVis are listed as:
> Project PolarVis is supported by FORTE, the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare; Uddannelses - og Forskningsstyrelsen, the Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science; the National Research, Development and Innovation Office Hungary; and FWF, the Austrian Science Fund under CHANSE ERA-NET Co-fund programme, which has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, under Grant Agreement

**Any other comments?**
The data for the dataset was initially collected as part of the *PolarVis* project which studies networked visual persuasion in and around climate movements in Europe. The link to the project can be found here: [[https://polarvis.github.io/]].


## Composition

__What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)?__ _Are there multiple types of instances (e.g., movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description._
=> The dataset comprises of Tweets data as well as Account data which are represented as two different elements.
 
The Tweets data comprise of the following attributes:

1. **text**: The main content of the tweet, including any retweet mentions, hashtags, URLs and other text content.
2. **entities**: Contains various subfields to identify special elements within the tweet text.
    - **mentions**: Lists users mentioned in the tweet.
    - **hashtags**: Lists the hashtags used within the tweet.
    - **annotations**: Gives contextual metadata on keywords used within the tweet including *probability*, *type* (Place, Other etc.), and *normalized_text*
    - **urls**: Lists the URLs used within the tweet. It includes the *url*, *expanded_url* and *display_url*.
3. **possibly_sensitive**: Boolean flag indicating whether the content of the tweet might be sensitive.
4. **edit_history_tweet_ids**: List of IDs representing the historical edits of the tweet, with the current tweet's ID.
5. **lang**: Language code of the tweet. (eg. "en" for English, "fr" for French etc.)
6. **created_at**: Timestamp of when the tweet was posted in ISO 8601 format.
7. **referenced_tweets**: Contains data on other tweets referenced within the tweet. This includes *type* (eg. "retweeted") and *id* of the referenced tweet.
8. **author_id**: ID of the user who posted the tweet. The key matching the accounts.tsv.
9. **conversation_id**: ID of the conversation thread this tweet belongs to, usually the same as **id** for the root tweet.
10. **id**: Unique identifier for the tweet.
11. **attachments**: Stores information about any media attached to the tweet, such as images or videos, referenced by *media_keys*.
    - **media_keys**: The key matching the media_lists.txt entries with the full image extension (file name pointer).
12. **public_metrics**: Contains engagement metrics for the tweet:
    - **retweet_count**: Number of retweets.
    - **reply_count**: Number of replies.
    - **like_count**: Number of likes.
    - **quote_count**: Number of times the tweet was quoted.
13. **context_annotations**: Metadata that categorizes the tweet within broader domains and entities (e.g., "Extreme Weather + Climate Change"), including:
    - **domain**: Category of context (e.g., "Events") and an *id*.
    - **entity**: Specific entity name and *id*.

The Account data comprises of:

1. **author_id**: ID of the user who tweeted.
2. **Type**: Lists the role of the author with regards to their involvement with the United Nations COP. (eg. "Private individuals", "Advocacy actors", "Journalistic actors" etc.)
3. **Lang**: Language code used by the author. (eg. "en" for English, "fr" for French etc.) 
4. **Stance**: Account's position on the resolutions passed by COP21. (eg. "For", "Unclear", "Against")

__How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?__
=> There are 2,260,916 entries of tweets and 1936 accounts of authors with their type, language and stances recorded.

__Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?__ _If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (e.g., geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (e.g., to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable)._
=> The dataset is technically a subsample of the data available on Twitter during that time period. It contains tweets from the time period 30/11 to 12/12 2015 with the hashtag "cop21". This is not representative of the larger set of all tweets on Twitter during the same period as the collection was focused only on a single hashtag. 

The authors were not involved in the data collection process, but merely downloaded the data in November 2024. 

__What data does each instance consist of?__ _Raw data (e.g., unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description._
=> Both, _raw data_ (text) and semi-structured features representing the interactions and meta-data surrounding the tweet. 

__Is there a label or target associated with each instance?__ _If so, please provide a description._
=> No, there is no target feature assigned (yet).

__Is any information missing from individual instances?__ _If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (e.g., because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, e.g., redacted text._
=> No, we have not omitted any features from the original data.

__Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (e.g., users, movie ratings, social network links)?__ _If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit._
=> Yes, each tweet is referenced by an ID and users are referenced by both their twitter handles and *author_id*. Links are made with the author_id to the users data.

__Are there recommended data splits (e.g., training, development/validation, testing)?__ _If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them._
=> No

__Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset?__ _If so, please provide a description._
=> Not that the authors are aware of.

__Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (e.g., websites, tweets, other datasets)?__ 
=> No, the dataset is not self-contained since there are URLs listed in the tweet entries. 
_If it links to or relies on external resources_:
     a) _Are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time?_
     => There are no guarantees that the external tweets will still exist as users could delete or edit the source and the entry could cease to exist or be changed on the internet. 
     b) _Are there official archival versions of the complete dataset? (i.e., including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created)_
     => NA
     c) _Are there any restrictions (e.g., licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a future user? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate._
     => The dataset download was protected by a password access granted by the course instructor with the link expiring after 5th Novemeber 2024.


__Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals non-public communications)?__ _If so, please provide a description._
=> The dataset contains Tweets that could be classified as personal identifiable information.

__Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety?__ _If so, please describe why._
=> Yes, social media and Twitter are known for having offensive, insulting, threatening, and anxiety-causing content since they allow a vast range of unfiltered opinions and reactions from users across the world.

__Does the dataset relate to people?__ _If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section._
=> Yes

__Does the dataset identify any subpopulations (e.g., by age, gender)?__ _If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset._
=> If we consider people on social media who post and interact with content under the "cop21" hashtag as a subpopulation, then yes.

__Is it possible to identify individuals (i.e., one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (i.e., in combination with other data) from the dataset?__ _If so, please describe how._
=> Yes, the data represents Tweets made by real people on Twitter. You can identify users by their username, name, author id, and by the content they post.

__Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (e.g., data that reveals racial or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)?__ _If so, please provide a description._
=> Yes, images and urls in the dataset show individuals' faces and therefore their ethnic origins.

__Any other comments?__


## Collection Process

__How was the data associated with each instance acquired?__ _Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how._
=> The original data was collected via the Twitter Academic API but the authors collected it via https://uppsala.box.com

__What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?__ _How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?_
=> The original collection mechanism (Academic API) cannot be validated but the download link was verfied via seeing the same data downloaded by two seperate devices.

__If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?__
=> By choosing the "cop21" hashtag and collecting tweets under that search key. The authors of this data card have not subsampled anything more.

__Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?__
=> The original data collected by the PolarVis project consists of people involved in "FORTE, the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare; Uddannelses - og Forskningsstyrelsen, the Danish Agency for Higher Education and Science; the National Research, Development and Innovation Office Hungary; and FWF, the Austrian Science Fund under CHANSE ERA-NET Co-fund programme". They have received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme.

Prof. Matteo Magnani who gave the authors access to the data is assumed to be paid by Uppsala Univesity. The authors Anand and Finn who are students are unpaid.

__Over what timeframe was the data collected? Does this timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)?__ _If not, please describe the time-frame in which the data associated with the instances was created._
