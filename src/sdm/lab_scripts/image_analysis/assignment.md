### Approaches Tried for Parts 1 and 2
- **Part 1 Approaches**: 
  - [List the methods you attempted, e.g., clustering techniques, topic modeling]
  - **Chosen Approach**: [State the selected approach, along with motivation based on theoretical considerations and validation results]
- **Part 2 Approaches**: 
  - [List the methods you attempted, e.g., perceptual hashing, feature vectors, image embeddings]
  - **Chosen Approach**: [State the selected approach, with a short motivation based on theoretical considerations and validation results]

### Analytical Angle
- **Statement**: [Clearly define the analytical angle you decided to study, such as temporal patterns, spreading, or account types]

### Description of Selected Image Groups
- **Cluster (Part 1)**: 
  - [Provide a brief description of the cluster, include a sample of images, and your label for it]
- **Nearly-Identical Images (Part 2)**: 
  - [Describe the group of nearly-identical images, explain why you consider them analytically equivalent, and provide a selection of these images]

### Summary and Description of Results
- **Results Overview**: 
  - [Summarize the main findings of your analysis]
