# Mining of Social Data Labs

Each week we get a small lab to do some social data mining on and then we get to write a lil' report.


## Dependency Management and Venvs
Use miniconda to manage the python environment for __python 3.11__

Use poetry to manage project requirements ie:
install deps
```bash
poetry install
```
add a new dep
```bash
poetry add <package name>
```
